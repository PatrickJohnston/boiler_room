# Chapter 9 — Mark and Lock

Hook
- Concrete image: A new lock plate sat bright against old paint; the screws bit fresh wood that didn’t match the door.

Beat goals
- Red chooses muscle: padlock attempt via “inspection” assist; marked squad shadows.
- Dugan names his price as “keep it neat or ride.” Johnny keeps it on paper; refuses envelope.
- Vic friction: he wants buckets; Johnny holds the lane.
- One aphorism max; ≤2 counter beats; one motif touch (city as metronome).
- End on a turn: real inspection notice served—paper dressed as muscle.

Notes
- Target: 1,100–1,300 words
- Motif: city as metronome

Draft

They moved at dawn when the street forgot its name. The alley door had a new idea about security. A bright lock plate, wrong metal, wrong hands. The screws were proud of themselves.

Maggie touched the plate with one finger. “That ours?”

“No,” I said. “Ours have sense.”

She looked at the blue X. It had a fresh coat. Smaller now, meaner. Theater learns from itself.

“Paper first,” I said. “Breath second.”

She nodded and unlocked the front, not the alley. We let the glass do the talking.

At ten a man in a gray coat came in with a clipboard that didn’t belong to him. He had city on the voice and Red in the shoes. He set the board on the bar and didn’t sit.

“Inspection,” he said. “Unscheduled. Complaint about an unlicensed device.”

“Our device is coffee,” I said. “Licensed by the pound.”

He didn’t smile. “Back door. Hardware. Also coin-operated entertainment.” He looked past me at the jukebox like he wanted it to answer for its life.

“Show me the paper,” I said.

He lifted a form that had numbers in the right places and signatures in hands I’d seen on better days. It would pass a glance. It wouldn’t pass a man with a memory.

“Wait here,” I said.

I took it to the window where the stamp lived. The light made the ink honest. The date was clean. The seal was tired. The city works, then it rests.

“You going to cooperate?” he said. His jaw worked gum that wasn’t there.

“We always do,” I said. “On paper.”

He didn’t like that. Men sent for muscle never do. He looked at the alley door like it had hurt his feelings. “We’ll need access.”

“You’ll get it,” I said, and set the form on a towel like evidence.

Vic came in with the morning cold on his coat and a hungrier look than usual. He saw the board, saw the man, and started counting rooms in his head.

“Bucket day,” he said to me under his breath.

“Not today,” I said.

“Why not?”

“Because they want us to push. We don’t.”

He hated that kind of answer. He loved action you could stack in a bag.

The gray coat walked to the jukebox and put a hand on the glass like a priest. “We’ll secure this pending review.”

“That isn’t how it works,” I said. “You note it. You schedule. You come back with a man who knows music from a meter.”

He turned. “You saying no?”

“I’m saying read your form,” I said. “Box twelve.”

He looked down. Box Twelve said SCHEDULED FOLLOW-UP with a blank line and a place for a date. He didn’t have a date. He had a line and a pair of friends outside.

The door opened on cue. Two men without coats felt like winter anyway. One with a key ring like a wind chime. The other had the kind of shoulders that carry people.

“Morning,” the ring said.

“Evening,” I said. It was the wrong time. He noticed.

Dugan came five beats after like he’d been told not to and did it anyway. He took a place between the jukebox and the alley door and looked bored. He was working.

“Problem?” he said.

“Inspection,” I said, and held the form so he could see it and not touch it.

The ring had opinions. “We have authority to secure.”

“Do you,” Dugan said. He read faster than he looked. “Funny, this here says follow-up. You boys are very eager.”

The gray coat tried to recover dignity he hadn’t earned. “Complaint mentions tampering.”

“Then you’ll be thrilled with a neat counter,” I said. “Two forty-two last night. Payout two thirty-four. Eight short. Manager signed. You can check Penn. They like to check Penn.”

That was the first beat and I let it sit. Numbers make men argue before they swing. Most days.

Vic bristled beside me. He wanted me to shut up and run a route that didn’t exist. He wanted cash that spends.

Dugan scratched his neck with one finger. “Here’s how it is,” he said, voice for the room, not the men. “You keep this neat. Real neat. No shout, no push, no reason to visit. You get to keep the glass. You hand me an envelope, I hand it back. You hand them a scene, I hand you a squad car. We clear?”

“We’re clear,” I said.

The ring smiled like a hinge. “We’ll be back with a padlock.”

“You won’t,” Dugan said. “Not today.”

They left the cold behind. The gray coat took his form and forgot to ask for a copy. He’d remember later and blame someone else.

Vic let the air out slow. “You keep dodging,” he said. “At some point the fist finds you.”

“It always does,” I said. “We choose where.”

He shook his head. “Buckets would buy us a better choice.”

“Buckets buy noise,” I said. “Noise brings more fists.”

He looked at the bright plate on the alley door. “They’ll come back with steel.”

“They might,” I said. “We’ll have paper.”

He laughed once without humor. “Paper burns.”

“Sometimes it doesn’t,” I said. That was the aphorism and I let it be one.

We opened slow. Regulars came in with their quiet. The radio lagged a breath behind the city and tried to catch up. The metronome didn’t care.

At one fifteen the Ford took the corner like it owned the block. The gray coat rode shotgun. The ring and the shoulders in back. They parked crooked and legal.

Maggie went to the register without being told. She put the receipt book on the rail where men can read. She posted the last stamp above it just because.

“Let them read us,” she said.

The door swung and stalled on the bright plate like it was thinking.

“Follow-up,” the gray coat said. He had a new form. It looked better than the first. Someone had fixed the seal.

“Congratulations,” I said. “You learned to schedule.”

He held it out. “Sign for receipt of notice.”

I read it. Real numbers. Real office. The date was today and the hour now. They had dressed muscle in a suit and taught it to spell.

“Fine,” I said, and signed where men sign when they can’t help it.

“We’ll secure pending review,” he said, happy to be back on the line he memorized.

“Not without inventory,” I said. “You list the coins in the box. You list the records in the slot. You count in front of us, and you seal it with our signatures. Or you leave it where it is and pencil your threat.”

He looked at Dugan. Dugan didn’t blink. “Neat,” he said. “Or ride.”

The ring had the lock ready. He set it on the bar so we could see the teeth. He liked the sound it made when he put it down.

“Inventory,” I said again.

“Count it yourself,” the ring said.

“That’s not how it works,” I said. “You want custody, you take the weight.”

That was the second beat. Counters make men tired when they expected easy.

Maggie brought out a pad and a pencil that had been sharpened to a mean point. “Start with what you can see,” she said. “We’ll do the back last.”

They argued about the order. Red’s boys didn’t like being clerks. They put the lock back in the pocket and took out a sheet instead. Paper changed their minds for them.

An hour later the jukebox was still ours and the door had a new nail where a padlock would have gone. The notice sat under the stamp. The blue X on the alley door didn’t look so sure of itself.

Vic stood with his hands open like he’d lost something. “You win today,” he said. “Tomorrow they bring more men.”

“Tomorrow we’re open,” I said. “And posted.”

At close a different man brought a different envelope and slid it toward me with two fingers. “For coffee,” he said.

“Keep it,” I said.

He didn’t like that either.

We locked up. The new plate looked back at me. It would want a padlock like a hungry mouth wants a spoon.

The notice under the stamp had a time in red pencil. Ten a.m. tomorrow. Real inspection. Real authority. The turn came dressed as paperwork. Muscle in a suit.

I put the towel over the form like a blanket. The city kept time. We tried to sleep on it.
