Re: Variance — Coin Counter vs. Payout (Penn Corridor)

Summary
- Observed mismatches between cabinet counter windows and recorded payouts/ledger entries across multiple Penn/North Side rooms during routine service calls.
- Request reconciliation prior to next collections cycle to avoid inspector rechecks.

Examples (times approximate)
1) Supper club on Penn (12:58–1:20)
   - Counter window at open: 212
   - Payout shown to manager: “round” disbursement
   - Ledger entry observed: 150
   - Note: Manager present; no service access to coin box by outside parties.

2) North Side Lanes (1:28–1:35)
   - Counter window at open: 318
   - Payout shown: round figure
   - Ledger entry: differed from window; post-service window read zeroed for cooling period (manager-requested)
   - Note: Cabinet serviced for hum; manager present.

3) Gin mill off Penn (1:53)
   - Collector paid on a round number
   - Counter window did not show round when closed

Action Requested
- Compare route sheets against counter-window reads for 1/— (Wed/Fri cadence) in the above rooms.
- Clarify payout rounding policy to on-premise managers to align visible counters with ledger disbursements.
- Confirm whether future collections should be demonstrated at cabinet or away from patron view.
