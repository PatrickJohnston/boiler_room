Johnny Byrne — Character Sketch (LLM Brief)

• Core Identity
 • Protagonist: itinerant professional con man with a gambler’s discipline, not a
 thrill-seeker.
 • Age: late 30s to early 40s; American; reads blue-collar smart with a veteran’s caution.
 • Operating principle: “Clean exits beat big scores.” Values control, discretion, and
 plausible deniability.
 • Worldview: People run on pride, fear, need, and habit; push pride last.
• Current Status Quo (series continuity)
 • Pittsburgh-born, North Side; recently home after his first federal bid—two and a half years at Leavenworth (mid-1950s timeline; Alcatraz as alt if needed). Carries rib damage and a reminder not to overreach.
 • Reuniting with old mentor/partner Vic Harlan for a hometown route play; Lena Marlowe exists in canon but sits offstage here unless needed as a permitting “friend at the counter.”
 • Pattern: rolls into a town broke enough to say yes, smart enough to avoid handcuffs, leaves with just enough to keep moving—except Pittsburgh pulls him back and costs reputation when he keeps civilians clean.
• Goals and Fears
 • Primary goal: stay solvent and free; protect the few people he lets close.
 • Secondary goal: run elegant plays that don’t spill; win by exit, not by pile.
 
 • Fears: locked rooms, sticky partners, escalation by pride. Hates variables he can’t pace (cameras, new bosses, panic). Extra edge: coming home to Pittsburgh makes pride harder to keep out of the math.
 • Long view: no empire, no crew—just the road and a working body.
• Competence and Methods
 • Strengths: pattern recognition, read of rooms, timing under pressure, error-budget
 thinking, quiet leadership.
 • Skills: cold reads, cover stories, paperwork fluency (markers, collateral), light
 surveillance tradecraft, clean handoffs.
 • Method: break a con into signals and cadence; keep the ledger simple; exploit “optics
 over pride” in marks.
 • Decision heuristics: if the exit degrades, cut. If pride enters the math, step off. If
 a partner freelances, narrow the play.
• Personality and Voice
 • Voice: first-person past, economical, hardboiled “Block-like” rhythm; concrete nouns,
 tight verbs, no filigree.
 • Temperament: cool, wry, unsentimental in action; soft spot for competence and fairness;
 keeps score privately.
 • Humor: dry, situational; one-line observations that bite without swagger.
 • Emotional range: restrained; the charge lives in subtext and choice, not speechifying.
• Moral Code and Lines
 • Will not harm civilians for gain; won’t con the desperate for rent money.
 • Will walk from a score rather than let blood or lock someone into a trap.
 • Red lines: torture, sexual violence, cruelty for sport, using kids. Won’t sell out a
 partner’s life to save face.
 • Violence: swift and consequential when forced; aftermath matters (pain, cleanup, how
 it changes the next move).
• Relationships (anchors for stakes)
 • Vic Harlan: mentor and old partner; mid-50s, noise and appetite. Johnny respects Vic’s hustle and has real affection for him, but limits his radius; simmering rivalry for shot-caller status on this play.
 • Lena Marlowe: skilled dealer; the edge and the risk. Real chemistry; Johnny protects
 her exit even at cost to the score.
 • Antagonists (type): prideful bosses (e.g., used-car magnate), floor managers who smell
 a seam, small-time cops who want a favor.
• Physicality and Tells
 • Build: lean, durable; moves like someone who’s been hit and learned pacing.
 • Pain markers: ribs flare on stairs, doors, and cold; he registers it, adjusts cadence,
  • Tells he controls: stillness before pushes; eyes clock cameras, exits, hands.
 • Dress: clean, forgettable; pockets arranged for exit, not bravado.
• Recurring Motifs and Lexicon (keep consistent)
 • “Optics over pride” (choose what looks clean over what feels big).
 • “Clean clause” (non-negotiable terms that preserve the exit).
 • “COUNT DAYLIGHT” (verbal kill switch to abort when optics turn).
 • “Luck with a commute” (his way to explain bias or edge without sermon).
 • Signals/ledger: watch=cough; ear=nickels; rail>3=smoke walk. Use sparingly and
 consistently.
• Conflict Levers for Plotting
 • External: house heat upgrades (new ball, new camera angles), a mark’s paranoia, a
 partner’s freelancing, law sniffing around collateral.
 • Internal: desire to protect vs. need to cut; pride twinges from past failures vs.
 discipline to exit.
 • Time pressure: “camera settle” windows, guard rotations, loan markers maturing,  partners getting jumpy.
 • Choice architecture: present him with two clean losses and one dirty win; he chooses
 the clean loss and makes it feel like a win.
• Do / Don’t for Portrayal
 • Do: show competence through action; explain cons in motion via small, precise details;
 let consequences land.
 • Do: keep sentences tight; let subtext carry feeling; make choices cost him something.
 • Don’t: deliver exposition dumps about the con; don’t glamorize violence; don’t turn
 him into a moral scold or a quip machine.
 • Don’t: depower him via coincidence; if he loses, it’s to his own rules or a smarter
 counter.
• Dialogue and Interior
 • Dialogue: clipped, specific; uses shorthand with pros, plain talk with civilians; lies
 clean when needed, confesses rarely.
 • Interior: tactical, sensory (camera hum, chip weight, shoe squeak, breath timing);
 registers body pain and room temperature.
  • Examples of cadence (tone, not literal lines): “The room ran hot and proud. We ran
 cooler.”
• How to Progress His Arc (next installment hooks)
 • Press his “clean exits” creed: force a choice where protecting someone requires a
 visible, reputational loss.
 • Put him under a system he can’t pace (digital eyes, biometric doors) to evolve his
 methods.
 • Test partner trust: one partner demands buckets; another demands a promise he can’t
 keep clean.
 • Let an old mistake arrive with paperwork—something that looks civil but can box him in
 if he plays it proud.


Use this to keep voice, ethics, and methods stable across scenes. Keep the camera on his
decisions and the consequences; let the craft show through the cut, not the brag.
