Draft

Two pins fell on an empty lane. No ball. The manager swore like a prayer you say twice a day and never hear yourself say. Vic carried the bag and let the door close slow behind us.

“Radio men,” he told the boy at the shoe counter.

The boy nodded, grateful to believe anything. He waved us toward the back where the jukebox sat between a trophy case and a picture of a team that used to win.

The room smelled like oil and cheap beer. The oil felt honest.

I checked the cabinet without touching the lock. The hum was real. The belt would be fine. The problem lived in the coin box a room down the line.

“Ticket?” the manager said, appearing from a side door like a coin out of a sleeve.

Vic showed him the back of a blank card. The manager looked at the front, then the door, then us, and decided to remember later. He left us to it.

We set our places. Vic near the door with the bag on a chair. Me in front of the cabinet with my hands where rooms could see them. The lanes took a breath on the minute. The city kept time for us.

At one thirteen a man with a broom swept the same square twice. At one fifteen a phone rang and nobody moved. At one twenty a woman laughed at a joke that wasn’t funny. At one twenty-eight the pin with the union walked in with a ledger under his coat and a smile a size too small.

I coughed once and bent over the cabinet like I meant to be useful. Vic watched the door. The pin didn’t look at us. He set his hat on the table where a man would see it if a man wanted to know who owned the room.

“Hum?” the manager said from nowhere.

“Heat,” I said. “We’ll draw it off.”

I popped the back with my ring and two fingers. No show. No noise. The belt was fine. I looked past it. The counter window read 318. The number told one story. The pin would write another.

“Paper first,” I said, not loud. Vic moved a receipt book to the edge of the counter where the manager could pretend he’d left it there himself.

The pin opened the coin box with a key that had lived in his pocket too long. He counted where everyone could see his hands and nobody could see the bag. He paid out a round number you could split in your head and wrote a different number in the ledger you couldn’t.

“Counter,” Vic murmured.

“One,” I said.

He let the second live for later.

I drew the hum down with a trick you can learn if you listen to electric motors long enough. The cabinet quieted. The room read us as men who fixed things.

At one thirty-four the jaw arrived—broad shoulders, no pin, a jaw that did the talking. He didn’t like that we were furniture. He liked that we were useful. He stayed close enough to be a wall.

“Five minutes,” I said to the manager. “We’ll swap a filter and let it cool.”

The manager nodded like he understood the words. He didn’t. He liked that they sounded like words a man uses when he means to do right.

Vic set the bag near my hand and looked past me at the lanes. Two pins fell on an empty lane again. No ball. The boy at shoes crossed himself.

“Bad wire,” I said. “It’ll pass.”

“Let it,” the manager said.

The pin closed the ledger and made a point of putting it away slow. The jaw watched his hands. Good. Hands are loud if you’re listening.

I slid the old coin box free and set it near the edge. The cabinet across the aisle had the twin. The line between them was short and quiet. Rooms like that. They like fixes that don’t brag.

“Watch,” Vic said.

I coughed. The jaw turned to see who needed a drink. The pin looked at his hat like it might jump. The manager took two steps toward a phone that had stopped ringing.

I switched the boxes.

It took less than a breath. A breath is a long time when your ribs talk in winter. Mine did. I held it like I was saving money.

The hum settled into a lower note. The window read 0 because I’d let it. The manager smiled. He thought that meant new.

“Fresh as Sunday,” he said.

“Don’t run it hot for ten,” I said. “Let it find its own speed.”

He nodded and went to tell someone he’d fixed something.

The pin took his hat and the jaw left the wall. They didn’t hurry. Men who think they own a neighborhood don’t learn hurry until it costs them.

We packed the bag slow. Vic did the zipper like a man who didn’t want to wake a baby. The boy at shoes watched our hands like he wanted to be us when he got older and smarter.

At the door, the manager remembered the card. “If it acts up,” he said.

“It won’t,” I said. “If it does, call and keep the cabinet closed until we get here.”

He liked being told a rule. It makes a man feel like he’s part of the work.

Outside, the street took our breath and kept it. We gave it willingly. Paper first. Breath second.

“Buckets?” Vic said as we walked toward the tailor who fought his antenna at two thirty.

“Not today,” I said.

“You’re going to starve on nickels.”

“I like living on them,” I said.

He carried the bag and didn’t argue out loud.

We stood in front of the tailor’s window and watched a race call chase itself around the dial. The man inside adjusted the antenna with a patience I envied. The result came late. The city pretended it was live. The city liked pretending.

“Jaw saw your hands,” Vic said.

“He saw what I wanted him to,” I said. “He saw a man fix a hum and a manager nod. He saw paper on the counter and a number in a window that tells one story. He’ll tell himself the rest.”

“You make the truth loud,” Vic said. It wasn’t a question.

“That’s the whole trick,” I said, and let the line be the one we spent for the day.

The bag felt heavier when he shifted it. My ribs reminded me I’d saved a breath and would owe it later. The wind came up off the river and set the city’s metronome back to work.

We walked toward it and let it count us in.
