Great—here’s a tight, series-forward plan for The Jukebox Route that fits Johnny’s code,
rhythm, and 50k target. I’ve kept the play grounded in real route mechanics (exclusive
contracts, cabaret/amusement licensing, coin-box counters), with clean/dirty choice
points and a reputational cost that advances his arc.

Logline

• A bar owner being squeezed off her jukebox route asks Johnny for help. He builds a
front around cabaret and amusement permits, swaps coin boxes to expose the route boss’s
own skim to his backers, and has to choose between a big flip with blood or a clean exit
that burns his name in the city to keep a civilian breathing.

Setting

• Pittsburgh/North Side route circuit; winter; union bars, corner taverns, VFW posts; City-County Building counters; back-room sitdowns along Penn Avenue; Strip District, Lawrenceville, Troy Hill/Millvale, and South Side flats for route flavor.
• Period: early-to-mid 1950s tone; inspectors, cabaret/Public Place of Amusement stamps, amusement-device decals on machines.

Cast

• Johnny Byrne: Pittsburgh-born (North Side), recently home from his first federal bid (Leavenworth; Alcatraz as alt) after two and a half years; disciplined, ribs still flaring on stairs; “optics over pride,” “clean clause,” “COUNT DAYLIGHT.”
• Vic Harlan: Johnny’s old mentor, mid-50s; wants buckets—pushes to ride the skim for a larger play and to prove he can still call a shot.
• Maggie Rourke (bar owner, civilian): competent, fair, squeezed by the route.
• Red Malloy (Pittsburgh route boss): Irish North Side roots; union handshakes; smiles first. Skims his own locations, bullies independents, and hates being read by outsiders.
• Sgt. Dugan (Pittsburgh cop with tin): wants Maggie as his informant; sells “protection.”
• Mr. Falco (syndicate backer): cares about quiet revenue, not Red Malloy’s pride.
• Clerk Klein (City-County Building, permits desk): sells timing, not loyalty. Paperwork gate.


The Con (mechanics and leverage)

• Jukebox/cigarette routes run on exclusive location contracts, split revenue (e.g.,
50/50), weekly collections, sealed coin boxes with counters.
• Front: a “cabaret” stamp and amusement-device decals—optics that make Maggie look aligned with the City-County Building and too visible to squeeze quietly.
• Exposure play: swap coin boxes on Red Malloy’s top earners (e.g., a Strip District supper club, a North Side bowling alley, a South Side gin mill) to create a counter vs. payout mismatch; seed that discrepancy to Falco’s auditors so the heat falls inward.
• Exit cover: Johnny frames himself as the noisy problem so the syndicate removes Red Malloy
to protect their money; Maggie keeps her bar.
Four-Act Beat Sheet (target ~50k)

• Act I (12k): Hook and setup
 • Hook: Johnny walks into Maggie’s North Side bar during a midweek collection. Red Malloy’s men short the split and leave a broken stool and a smile.
 • Johnny’s price: a clean clause—no blood, no kids, no burn on civilians.
 • Homecoming note: Johnny’s back in Pittsburgh after two and a half at Leavenworth; streets feel the same, the faces don’t.
 • Recon: ride-alongs on the route from the Strip to Lawrenceville; clock collection times, meter reads, who pockets what. Learn Dugan’s “offer.” Vic smells buckets in Red Malloy’s skim pattern and frames this as a reunion play—“one for the old days.”
 • First turn: Johnny lands a narrow window at the City-County Building—Klein will “find” Maggie’s cabaret stamp if Johnny ghosts a rival application. Johnny refuses the dirty cross; finds a clean workaround through timing and a paid inspection recheck.
 
• Act II (14k): Build the machine
 • Acquire duplicate locks, fabricate swap boxes; map Red Malloy’s top three earners (Strip club, North Side lanes, South Side gin mill) and his pickup cadence.
 • Plant optics: Maggie’s permits posted; amusement decals straight; inspector visits “by the book.” Red Malloy reads it as a political shield and escalates.
 • First switch: clean swap on Location A under a jukebox service call; counters say $180, Red Malloy pays out on $110. Johnny seeds the shortfall to Falco’s auditor via a “concerned accountant” memo, not a threat.
 • Mentor-rival beat: Vic wants to take point, calls a bigger three-location night to “show the kid how it’s done.” Johnny shuts it down—keeps it narrow.
 • Midpoint turn: Red Malloy grabs Maggie’s bartender for a beating to send a message. Vic wants to hit three locations the same night, go loud. Johnny says no; COUNT DAYLIGHT stays in the plan.
 
 • Act III (14k): Pressure and choice
 • Falco schedules a “quiet audit.” Dugan pressures Maggie to inform or lose her cabaret stamp. Klein gets jumpy—someone asked for his pull file.
 • Second switch under heat—shadow tails from the Strip to Troy Hill. Johnny’s ribs flare on a stairwell—pace changes, tells controlled. He keeps it tight; the numbers still split wrong.
 • Dark turn: Red Malloy forces Maggie to sign an exclusive addendum—now it’s a trap, not a handshake. Vic freelances and tries a fourth swap to prove he still has the wheel; the shadow catches a whiff.
 • Ruin point: To keep Maggie breathing, Johnny can: a) blow the route and burn his name with Falco, or b) finish the play and risk Red Malloy taking Maggie for leverage. He burns himself—calls Falco’s man, offers “proof,” demands Maggie be left alone.
• Act IV (10k): Sitdown and exit
 • Sitdown: Back room in the Strip. Falco, Red Malloy, books. Johnny presents counters vs. payouts as if he’s a rival angling for Red Malloy’s chair. Optics over pride: no speech, just numbers.
 • Violence: swift, unglamorous. A warning beating for Red Malloy; one of his men goes down ugly outside. Johnny feels the aftermath, not the choreography.
 • Resolution: Maggie’s exclusive voided; she takes a small independent route with fair splits. Dugan backs off—Falco doesn’t want tin near his books now.
  Exit cost: Johnny is persona non grata with Falco’s people locally; he’s the loud civilian who made them move in his own hometown. Vic’s angry about the buckets left on the table. Johnny leaves with a small fee and a bigger loss—reputation—and a complicated win/lose with Vic: affection intact, supremacy settled for now.
 
 Key Choice Points (clean loss vs. dirty win)

• City hall cross: sabotage a rival’s permit (dirty win) vs. pay for a clean recheck
(clean loss). He stays clean.
• Midpoint escalation: triple-location raid (dirty win) vs. controlled two-switch pattern
(cleaner, smaller). He stays disciplined.
• Finale: keep it surgical and abandon Maggie (dirty win) vs. burn his own name to
protect her (clean loss). He takes the visible hit.

Signals and Abort Conditions

• Signals/ledger: watch=cough (delay collection), ear=nickels (counter mismatch),
rail>3=smoke walk (shadow close). Use sparingly and consistently.
• Abort phrase: “COUNT DAYLIGHT” when a shadow stays through a service call or an
inspector’s timing shifts.

Chapter Hooks (sample lines)
• Opening: “The jukebox man smiled like a dentist. It didn’t reach his eyes.”
• Midpoint: “The counters told one story. Red Malloy told another. Only one of them bled.”
• Finale: “Falco didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t have to.”

Research texture to sprinkle (authenticity without lecturing)

• Seeburg/Wurlitzer cabinets; sealed coin boxes with serial counters; route splits posted
behind the bar.
• Cabaret/Public Place of Amusement license placards; amusement-device decals; inspection
schedules and rechecks.
• Route man routines: rag, key ring, parts box; cigarette machines with column jams;
weekly cash-out notebooks.
• Bar owner economics: jukebox pays the light bill; Friday pull vs. Tuesday lull.

Series Arc Advancement

• Tests creed: he takes a reputational loss to protect a civilian, on purpose and in
daylight.
• Partner tension: Vic wants buckets; Johnny narrows his radius afterward.
  • Body keeps score: ribs and pacing matter in two close-quarters scenes; aftermath over
action.
• Consequence: strains Pittsburgh’s underworld tolerance for Johnny, which trims future options here while deepening the city as a recurring character and honest constraint.

Word Count Map

• Act I: 10–12 chapters, ~1k–1.2k each (setup, recon, first move).
• Act II: 10–12 chapters (build, first switch, midpoint hit).
• Act III: 10–12 chapters (heat, second switch, ruin point).
• Act IV: 8–10 chapters (sitdown, consequences, exit).

Open knobs to tune

• Include Vic as an on-page partner? I’ve written him in to test appetite. Lena can be
omitted or cameo as a permit-savvy “friend at the counter”—your call.
• Preferred neighborhood flavor (North Side, Strip District, Lawrenceville, Troy Hill/Millvale, South Side)?
• Level of on-page violence (keep swift and consequential per guide).

Additional Sample Scenes (Johnny’s voice)

Switch Two — Under Tail (Stairwell)

Hard soles on concrete. He tried to soften his step. The echo stayed. I let him have a flight, then changed the count—two steps, pause, one, breathe, two. He matched. A match means he’s watching, not working.

Vic waited at the landing with the tool bag.

“Your friend’s close,” he said.

“He thinks so.”

The bag hit the tread like a service call. I opened the cabinet. Cold air. Oil. Cigarettes. Swap in, swap out. The counter clicked once.

The echo stopped. He held the stair.

“COUNT DAYLIGHT?” Vic said.

“Not yet.”

We left through the kitchen into the alley. Fresh snow. Our prints only. He took the front door.

Ruin Point — The Call

Falco’s man answered on the third ring. I gave him numbers and locations.

“You want something,” he said.

“Maggie keeps breathing. Her permit stays up. You handle it quiet.”

“And you?”

“You can put my name on the problem line.”

He paused. “Done.”

Not my first choice. The right move.

Numbers Don’t Bleed — Sitdown Tag

Ledgers on the table. Big, worn. I set down counters and locations. Red Malloy blinked. Falco didn’t.

“You think you’re witty,” Red said.

“I think the math is clear.”

Falco raised a finger. A man moved. Trouble outside. Quick.

“Maggie keeps her bar,” Falco said. “You stay out of my money.”

“I live here,” I said.

“Not today.”

The meeting ended. So did my welcome.

Sample Pages (Johnny’s voice)

Opening – Midweek Collection (North Side)

The jukebox man smiled. His partner counted. Tuesday was quiet. Maggie stood at the end with a dish towel.

I took the service door and watched the room. Two men at the window. One at the corner. The one with the smile had the key ring and a pin on his lapel. He liked the weight of both.

They shorted her twenty dollars and a stool. The stool went when one of them leaned on it and kept leaning. He laughed. She didn’t. The pin flashed when he turned.

“"You the union?”

“Just a neighbor.”

“Then drink your beer, neighbor.” He flicked a coin and missed the tip jar. He wanted the miss seen.

Maggie put the towel down. “We’re square,” she said. “Take your cut and go.”

They went. The smile took the broken stool with him. The door shut. The room breathed.

“You shouldn’t talk to them,” she said.

“I didn’t,” I said. “I opened my mouth.”

She almost smiled. “You said you were done,” she said.

“I was,” I said. “Then I came home.”

Wind came under the door. The street was the same. Faces weren’t.

She poured coffee. Not whiskey. That told me two things. She wanted a favor. She wanted me alive to do it.

“Route’s got me,” she said. “Collections are light. Paperwork’s hung. Inspector says come back when it’s stamped.”

“Public Place of Amusement,” I said. “Cabaret.”

She nodded. “You know a guy?”

“I know a counter,” I said. “And a man at the counter who likes money better than friends.”

She looked at my coat. It didn’t fit. Two and a half years will do that.

“What’s it cost?” she asked.

“A clean clause,” I said. “No blood. No kids. No burn on civilians.”

“That it?”

“It’s the only thing that costs.”

She held my eyes. “Okay,” she said. “Clean.”

The door opened and let the cold in. Vic Harlan walked in with it.

“Johnny Byrne,” he said, and grinned. “Look what the river coughed up.”

We shook. His hands were the same. The rest of him wasn’t.

“You working?” he said.

“Thinking.”

He looked at Maggie, then at the door the route boys had used. “I got a thought,” he said. “You and me. One for the old days.”

I let him talk.

Act II Snippet — Mentor Flex

We sat in a booth at a diner on Penn. The coffee was bad and hot. Vic liked both.

“Three hits,” he said. “Same night. Strip club first, lanes second, gin mill third. They won’t know where the leak is. We ride the skim.”

“Or we light a signal fire,” I said. “Red reads smoke.”

He spread his hands. “You go narrow, you get nickels. You go wide, you get buckets.”

“I don’t need buckets,” I said. “I need daylight.”

He smiled. “COUNT DAYLIGHT,” he said, like a motto.

“You take the first,” he said. “I’ll watch your hands.”

“That’s the problem,” I said. “You don’t watch the room when you watch me.”

He nodded. “Then show me a room worth watching.”

Sitdown Tag — Numbers Over Pride

Ledgers open. Red Malloy’s thumb on a page. Grease under the nail. Falco stood.

I set the counters down. Named the rooms by what was in the curtains. The auditor watched the math.

Red started. Falco raised a hand. Silence.

“It’s subtraction,” I said. “Your man pays short.”

Falco nodded. The room moved. Pain followed. Not mine.

He closed the book. “Maggie keeps her bar,” he said. “You stay away from my money.”

“I’m from here.”

“Not anymore.”

I understood.

Additional Sample Scenes (Johnny’s voice)

The Counter — City-County (Klein)

The City-County Building smelled like wet wool and old paper. The line at the permits counter moved like it owed someone money and planned to pay in nickels.

Klein had a face made for saying no. He didn’t waste it.

“Cabaret stamp,” I said. “Recheck on an inspector’s note.”

He looked at the form like it had insulted his mother. “Backlog,” he said.

“Not if the timing’s right,” I said. I put a folded day’s wages on the ledge without looking at it. Looking is pride.

He didn’t touch it. “You could help yourself more if another application went missing,” he said. “These things happen.”

“They don’t happen to me,” I said. “I like my hands where I can see them.”

He considered the bill without looking either. Then he stamped the recheck and slid it back like it was his idea.

“You didn’t get this here,” he said.

“I was never here,” I said. “You were helpful anyway.”

Paper Trap — Exclusive (Red Malloy’s Addendum)

The addendum ran two paragraphs and a signature line. It said exclusive. It meant control.

Red Malloy smiled through it. He liked to keep his hands free. His thumb rested on the paper. Work grease in the nail.

Maggie read it. Then looked at me.

“It’s clean,” Red said.

“Paper’s clean,” I said.

He handed her a pen with his name on it. A clover on the clip.

“You sign, the route goes smooth,” he said. “You don’t, the stool breaks again.”

She signed. You don’t fight the paper at the table.

“Smart,” he said. “Everybody wins.”

“Not how the numbers work,” I said.

Concerned Accountant — Seed the Shortfall

The stationery was cheap and plain. No letterhead. I typed with two fingers and didn’t write my name. I didn’t wear gloves. I used a handkerchief. It’s the same result and reads cleaner.

Numbers. Dates. Locations by description, not by name. The kind of detail an auditor believes because he can check it without me.

I put it in an envelope and walked it three extra blocks to a different mailbox. You don’t feed a pattern. You feed a system once and step away.

Falco’s people would call it a tip. I called it subtraction.

I went to the river and watched the ice move. Slow. It still moved.

Proud Talk — Pressure Ratchets (Johnny’s voice)

They didn’t order. They leaned. Two coats at the end of the bar, elbows wide. One wore a scuffed button; the other kept three nickels in a line and pushed the middle one with his finger. Slow.

“Malloy says the smile was a misunderstanding,” he said. “We’re all friends here.”

“We are,” I said. “When the math is.”

The other one laughed with his mouth closed. Bad teeth.

“Heard you been walking around with a toolbox,” he said. “Service calls, is it?”

“Stools break,” I said. “Radios too.”

They liked that.

“Red’s patient,” the nickel man said. “He likes to solve things with a pen.” He tapped the coins. “Signatures are cleaner than mops.”

“Paper’s a quiet room,” I said. “Until it isn’t.”

“We don’t need trouble,” he said. “We need rhythm. Wednesday, Friday. The lady gets her light bill. We get our rent. You get a beer.”

“Everybody laughs when a man tells them to,” I said. “I don’t have that kind of face.”

A voice from a table: “You talking to me?” The room shifted and settled. The coats didn’t look. They weren’t here to fight. They were here to see if I twitched.

I didn’t. I stood a nickel on its edge. It held. The coat watched it like a trick.

“Tell Red,” I said, “if he wants rhythm, stop stepping on the beat. Counters don’t care about smiles. They care about hands.”

The nickel fell. He watched that too.

“You think you’re funny,” he said.

“I think I’m counting,” I said. “You boys take the door. Leave the stool.”

They left the stool. They left the nickels lined wrong. I dropped them in the till and watched the door close. The room eased.

The Partners — Settled for Now (Johnny’s voice)

We took Penn until the neon thinned. The river ran black. Vic walked with his hands in his pockets.

“You burned it,” he said.

“I put it where it belonged,” I said.

He smoked and stared at the water. “We could’ve had buckets.”

“We had a woman breathing,” I said. “Buckets can wait.”

He nudged a cigarette butt toward the curb.

“You make it hard to like you when you’re right,” he said.

“I make it hard to follow me when I’m wrong.”

He let out one laugh.

“You ever think about leaving?” he asked.

“I did,” I said. “Then I came home.”

We stood a while. Trucks on the Strip. A whistle from somewhere it didn’t belong. The river under ice.

“You call the next one,” he said.

“I called this one.”

He nodded.

“Settled then,” he said.

“For now.”

We walked back toward the lights. The cold touched my ribs once. I let it.
