# Chapter 11 — Permit Window

Hook
- Concrete image: A numbered ticket hung from a manila clip; the City clock said two even and didn’t blink.

Beat goals
- Split day: Vic runs the 1:15/1:28 route under squeeze; Johnny and Maggie go to City for the 2 p.m. permit window.
- Red tests both lanes at once: a push at Penn; a “consultant” at City.
- Johnny keeps it on paper; declines intermediaries; files and timestamps the application; captures the sequence.
- Counters (two total): City receipt number out of sequence; Penn’s counter vs payout used to blunt the squeeze.
- One aphorism; one motif touch.
- End on a turn: application accepted and stamped, but a new compliance review gets scheduled to Friday—pressure crosses into route day.

Notes
- Target: 1,100–1,300 words
- Motif: city as metronome

Draft

At one ten Vic buttoned his coat like it was armor. He checked the bag and the service cards and looked at me like I’d picked the wrong day to love paper.

“You sure about City?” he said.

“They said no intermediaries,” I said. “I believe them when they write.”

He grunted. “They write with your blood when you aren’t looking.”

“Keep it neat,” I said. “No scenes. If they push, you count.”

He left at one twelve. I watched the mirror clock until the hands touched thirteen and a half. The city kept time without help. It always did.

Maggie tied the envelope with twine like she was packing a lunch for a child who bites. “We take this and we come back,” she said.

“We do,” I said. “If something breaks, Dugan has the number.”

City-County smelled like paper and cold stone. The woman at the desk handed me a numbered ticket and kept her eyes on her own stack.

“Window Three for adjunct,” she said. “Two o’clock.”

The clock on the far wall said one fifty-eight. It would not be hurried. Men are.

Ms. Hart came out from a side door at two and nodded once without smiling. She didn’t wave us forward. The number did that for her.

“Forms,” she said.

I slid the packet, the receipts, the serial sheet copy. She flipped without ceremony, then slowed on the napkin with our terms.

“You bring everything,” she said.

“We count,” I said.

A man in a good suit and bad instincts put a card on the ledge and smiled like he was about to make friends. “Compliance liaison,” he said. The card said CONSULTANT.

“Intermediary,” I said.

Ms. Hart didn’t look up. “Not required.”

The man’s smile didn’t know where to go. “It speeds things along.”

“Nothing speeds the City along,” I said. “It moves when it’s ready.”

He left the card anyway and drifted down the line like a salesman in a store that doesn’t need what he sells.

“Fee,” Ms. Hart said.

Maggie counted bills slow and even. “Receipt,” she said, just as even.

The clerk at Three ran the till. The number on the receipt came out wrong. Not the amount. The sequence.

“This jumps,” I said.

The clerk blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Your last was 11837,” I said, pointing to the stack in his drawer. “This is 11835. Paper remembers when men don’t.”

That was the aphorism. I kept my mouth shut after it.

Ms. Hart looked, compared, and didn’t like what she saw. She reached for another book from the shelf. “Use this,” she said to the clerk. “Staple both.”

He did. The top copy got an ink stamp that sounded like a door latching. I wrote the time down anyway. Two oh-six, City’s clock.

On Penn at one twenty-six the pin and the jaw arrived together to make it look official. Vic told me later the manager had sweat on his lip and flair in his hands.

“Collections,” the jaw said.

“Service,” Vic said. He put the dead-number card on the rail where hands could see and minds could pretend to understand. “Radio hum.”

The pin kept the book close. Too close. He opened the box. The counter window said 207. The payout to the till said 198 and went fast.

“Counter,” Vic said, quiet. He let the word sit.

The jaw decided to be muscle with an audience. He made a move like lids slam themselves. Vic moved his hand slower than the lid and still lost a little meat.

He told me it stung, like winter air does. He told me he didn’t give them a scene. He kept the card on the rail and watched the pin pretend to write route across the top of a page that would never be read.

Back at Three, Ms. Hart took our signatures and gave us hers. “Observation continues,” she said. “Adjunct goes to review. Friday morning, nine.”

“Friday is route,” Maggie said.

“I don’t set the day,” Ms. Hart said. “I show up on it.”

The consultant glided back with his smile intact. “Friday’s tricky,” he said. “I can smooth it.”

“No,” I said.

He touched the card. “You’ll have my number.”

“I won’t,” I said, and slid it back to him without touching it.

Ms. Hart stamped the top page. The sound felt like a promise that wasn’t personal. Those are the only ones that hold.

Outside, Dugan leaned on a pillar and watched the pigeons calculate angles.

“You went in,” he said.

“They asked,” I said. “We listened.”

He nodded at the envelope in my hand. “Red’s pushing Penn.”

“I figured,” I said.

“Your man okay?”

“He’ll count with nine fingers for a day,” I said. “He kept it neat.”

Dugan’s mouth moved like it might become a smile and chose not to. “Friday at nine,” he said. “That’s a nice hour for problems.”

“We’ll bring coffee,” I said.

At the bar, the stamp held the late light again. The observation order had a new friend under it—the application copy, staple proud.

Vic poured his own coffee and didn’t put sugar in. He held his hand flat on the counter like he was testing a table he’d built.

“They wanted the lid,” he said.

“They always do,” I said.

He looked at the receipt we brought back. “Friday?”

“Nine,” I said. “We’ll have to split on a split.”

He shook his head. “They’re getting smarter.”

“So do we,” I said.

Maggie slid the compliance card onto the bar with two fingers and let it sit in the open. The name on it didn’t matter. The idea did.

“They’ll send him back,” she said.

“Then he can watch,” I said. “We’ll post for him too.”

The radio caught a race a breath late and bragged about it anyway. Trucks took the hill in even rows. The city kept time and didn’t care who danced.

At close, a boy from City brought a second slip. REVIEW SCHEDULED, it said in black with a line under it: Friday, nine. Someone had underlined the nine twice in pencil. Not Hart’s hand.

We locked up. The holes from the wrong screws on the back door waited like small mouths. The blue X looked tired.

We had paper that moved. Friday would test if it could run.
