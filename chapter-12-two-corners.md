# Chapter 12 — Two Corners

Hook
- Concrete image: The review slip curled at the edge where a thumb had held it; the City clock ticked toward nine and didn’t look back.

Beat goals
- Parallel beats: Johnny and Maggie at City review with Ms. Hart; Vic on route faces a harder squeeze at Penn and a second hit at a lanes room.
- Red escalates muscle under cover of paper while trying to slow the permit—consultant returns.
- Dugan intervenes once, narrowly, to keep it “neat,” but warns the line is close.
- Counters (two total): City chain-of-custody vs consultant’s altered sequence; Penn counter vs payout under duress.
- One aphorism; one motif touch.
- End on a turn: Ms. Hart approves adjunct pending one last inspection, but Penn goes hot—Vic takes a real cost (ribs/hand), and a lock shows up on a different back door. The city keeps time while they bleed.

Notes
- Target: 1,100–1,300 words
- Motif: city as metronome

Draft

At eight fifty-five the corridor outside Window Three smelled like floor wax and fear. The review slip curled at one corner like it wanted to leave. It didn’t.

Maggie stood with the envelope under her arm and a jaw set for winter. She didn’t talk. She watched the clock.

Ms. Hart opened the side door at nine and waved us in. No ceremony. The consultant was already in the room. His card sat on the table like a stray chip.

“Who invited him?” I said.

“Nobody,” Ms. Hart said. “He invites himself.”

He smiled. “I coordinate,” he said.

“You confuse,” I said.

Ms. Hart put the chain ledger on the table and laid yesterday’s corrected receipt on top. “Sequence issue resolved,” she said. “Ledger consistent.”

He slid a new receipt forward like a magician with a second deck. The number looked right. The ink looked too fresh.

“Staple that,” I said.

“We will,” Ms. Hart said, and reached for the stapler. The staple hit with a sound that calmed me more than it should have.

On Penn at nine twelve the pin came in without the jaw, which meant the jaw was already in the back room. Vic read it. He put the dead-number card on the rail and kept his hands where men could see them and misjudge him.

“Collections,” the pin said.

“Service,” Vic said. The box read 189. The payout hit 176 and paused like it might change its mind and didn’t.

“Counter,” Vic said, quiet.

The jaw came out of the back and made the aisle small. “You got a lot to say for service,” he said.

“I write better than I talk,” Vic said, and lifted the card.

At City, Ms. Hart asked simple questions and looked at the answers like they might lie. “Observation compliant,” she said. “Adjunct review—recommend approval with condition: second inspection next week.”

“What condition?” I said.

“Selections need labeling,” she said. “No handwritten titles.”

“We can print,” I said.

The consultant leaned in. “Permit comes with ongoing fees. I can advise schedule.”

“You can leave,” Ms. Hart said without heat. He didn’t.

Dugan’s shadow cut across the glass outside and then withdrew. He was there and then not. He liked to move on the beat.

At the lanes on North Side the manager tried to be generous with someone else’s money again. Vic watched the payout land round and light. The counter said 244. The till said 236. The ledger stayed hidden.

“Counter,” he said. That was the second beat and he let it ring.

The jaw decided to make an example. He pushed the lid hard. Vic’s hand met it halfway and lost. Something gave. He kept his face quiet and his other hand on the service card like it was a cross.

The boy at the shoe bench looked up and then down fast. Men learn what to see.

At City the consultant produced a memo with a header that wanted to be official when it grew up. “Compliance review suggests postponement pending neighborhood input,” he said.

“From who?” I said.

He gestured with an empty hand. “Stakeholders.”

Ms. Hart didn’t sigh. “No postponement,” she said. “Adjunct recommended. Final sign-off Monday, after labeling.”

The consultant reached for the paper and met Dugan’s hand instead. I hadn’t seen him come in. He put one finger on the memo and looked at the man until the memo forgot what it was.

“You boys keep finding paper in alleys,” Dugan said. “City’s got its own.”

The consultant took his hand back like it had been burned by cold.

On Penn, the jaw smiled the way a man does before a bad decision. He reached for Vic’s collar. Vic stepped back and let a chair take the grab. It clattered. Everyone heard it. The room held its breath.

Dugan showed up in that silence like he’d been hiding behind it. He didn’t raise his voice. “Neat,” he said. “Or ride.”

The jaw let go. He didn’t like it. He liked the alternative less.

“Write your number,” Vic said to the pin. “I’ll write mine next to it.” He kept his broken hand still and his voice from shaking.

At City, Ms. Hart stamped the recommendation with a seal that didn’t care about anyone in the room. “Next week for the second inspection,” she said. “Label your selections. Keep the observation clean.”

Maggie nodded once. “We post,” she said.

We stepped out into the corridor. The clock said nine forty-seven. The city moved on. It always does.

Vic walked back into Maggie’s at one with his hand wrapped in a bar rag. He didn’t make a face until he sat down.

“They put a lock on the back of DeMarco’s,” he said. “Not ours. Same plate as the one we pulled.”

“They’re moving doors,” I said.

He poured coffee with his good hand and watched it steam. “They’ll come back for ours.”

“They might,” I said. “We’ll be posted. We’ll be labeled.”

Maggie laid a sheet of paper on the bar. It had neat typed titles for every record in the box. “I started,” she said.

She had. It looked like she’d been preparing to be legal her whole life.

“Red’s not going to love Monday,” Vic said.

“Red can read,” I said. “If he can’t, someone will read it to him.”

The pain found me when I picked up the sheet. Ribs remind you when you get confident. I put the paper down and let the breath pass.

At close we checked the back. The holes from the wrong screws looked older. The blue X was a ghost of itself. Across the alley DeMarco’s had a new plate and a brand-new padlock. It shone like a coin you don’t spend.

We didn’t touch it. We looked, and then we went in. The city kept time for both of us.

Turn
- Adjunct recommended with labeling condition; second inspection set for next week (final sign-off Monday).
- Penn goes hot; Vic’s hand injured under a lid but keeps it neat; Dugan enforces once.
- New lock appears at DeMarco’s back door—Red moves muscle next door instead of here for now.
