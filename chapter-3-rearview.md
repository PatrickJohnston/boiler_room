Draft

The wind got under the service door and lifted the mat. Maggie put a chair on it and went back to her bottles. I shrugged into the coat. It still didn’t fit.

I walked. Penn to the bridge, then the North Side up and over like I used to. Trucks worked the Strip. Steam rose out of grates and made its own weather at the corner.

Two and a half changes a man. You carry it in your shoulders and in the way stairs feel when the cold gets into your bones. Leavenworth was a place. Pittsburgh was the cost.

At the first block I passed a barber with a radio on. The announcer ran scores like a man late for a train. I didn’t know the team anymore. I knew the ad that followed—soap, cigarettes, one car brand telling you about another. The city liked noise. It liked rhythm.

A kid shoveled a stoop and watched me pass. Not curious. Accounting. Coats read like ledgers. Mine said out-of-town, even when it wasn’t.

I took the iron stairs behind a lane to save a block. Ribs talked on the second flight. I kept going. On the landing, two men smoked. They moved just enough for me to slip by and made me feel the space they’d given.

“You from around here?” one said.

“I used to be,” I said.

He looked at my hands. The other one looked at my shoes. They nodded to each other like I’d answered a different question.

On Federal, the butcher’s window was new, the man behind it wasn’t. He’d lost hair and kept his stance. He raised the knife like a hello and went back to the bone.

The City-County Building sat across the river like a dare. I stood where I could see the windows without counting them. You don’t win at the counter; you time it.

I crossed at the light and cut through a lobby that smelled like wet wool and paper. The guard read his newspaper until a man with a hat too clean made him fold it. The hat took the elevator like it belonged to him. I took the stairs. Third flight asked me what I was made of.

In the permits hall, a line had already decided who was important. Men with folders. Women with patience. A clerk with a face made for no. Klein was at Window Three. He had a pencil behind his ear and the look of a man who enjoyed moving a problem an inch at a time.

I didn’t step up. I watched the clock. I watched a messenger with a leather bag drop a stack and get a nod past rules the rest of us had to follow. I watched a secretary bring coffee that didn’t spill. The building ran on timing and small courtesies.

Klein saw me see him and looked away. Good. Men who sell timing don’t like to be stared at. They like to be recognized without the formality of names.

I left without speaking. On the way down I met a man with tin at his belt coming up. He smiled at the railing.

“Morning, Byrne,” he said.

“Sergeant.”

“Tell the lady her recheck looks better if she has a friend.”

“She has one.”

“You?”

“Me.”

He nodded and kept going. He didn’t touch the rail.

Back on Penn, the day had decided to snow. It came small and straight and meant to stay. I walked into it and felt the city set its pace around me. A trolley bell hit and stopped. A man cursed at a truck and the truck won.

I ducked into a diner with coffee and a cracked pie case. The waitress wrote my order before I opened my mouth.

“Cold,” she said.

“It’s January,” I said.

“Feels like February.”

“Worse things feel like February,” I said.

She poured and left me to it. The coffee did its job. A man in a booth shook his head at a headline about a councilman who liked money too much to keep it quiet. I didn’t know his name. I knew his type.

I took the long way back toward Maggie’s. Past a bowling alley where the leagues hung their jackets on nails and a man oiled the lanes with a can on a stick. Past a supper club that promised music on weekends. Past a gin mill where the door never stopped moving on a Friday.

Route man’s eyes came back. Cabinet backs. Locks. Angles. Counters in little windows that told one story while the men with keys told another.

At Maggie’s alley, a set of prints told me I wasn’t the first walk-through. Broad heel, narrow toe, cheap rubber. The kind of shoe a man buys when someone else is paying. They stopped at the back door and turned around. Twice.

The door had the same wrong screws. I put a hand on the jamb and felt the give. I’d brought wood screws. I turned two by hand and felt the door answer different.

Inside, Maggie had the radio low and the register open. She looked up like she’d kept count on my steps.

“How’s the City?” she said.

“Like always,” I said. “If you talk first, you pay twice.”

“I can be quiet.”

“You can. You will.”

She nodded at my coat. “Still not right?”

“It’s getting there.”

“You eat?”

“Coffee.”

She pushed a plate with toast and butter. I ate because she told me to without saying it.

“Dugan?” she said.

“He said he likes friends.”

“He’s not wrong.”

“He’s expensive.”

“You going to tell me what you saw?” she said.

“I saw a man who sells timing,” I said. “He’s on the clock after lunch.”

“I can be there after lunch.”

“You’ll be there at one fifteen. You’ll wait until one twenty-eight. Then you’ll step up and ask for a recheck on an inspector’s note. You won’t say a name.”

“I can do that.”

“If a clean hat goes in ahead of you, you’ll let him. If a messenger drops a stack, you’ll let him. When you step up, you’ll have the form filled and the fee ready. You’ll smile once. Then you won’t.”

She listened like it was a recipe.

“Say it straight,” she said. “What’s the play?”

“We don’t beat them,” I said. “We put the City between us and let Red decide how public he wants to be.”

She watched my face. “Go on.”

“We make the room look like it belongs,” I said. “Stamp on the glass. Serial sheet in the drawer. Receipts where they can be found. Jukebox numbers that add when the man with keys says they should. We don’t whisper. We post.”

“That’s a con?”

“A con’s a story with props,” I said. “Ours is simple: we’re square. If they lean after that, it looks like a shakedown in front of the City. If they want a padlock, they need paperwork. Paperwork leaves fingerprints.”

“You mean we lie.”

“No,” I said. “We make the truth loud. We say nothing and let the glass talk. Men like Red sell fear. We sell time.”

“How?”

“Time is the gap between what is and what looks like it,” I said. “We close that gap on paper and let them feel it. They step over, or they step back.”

“And if they don’t step at all?”

“Then they change the man on the route, skim smaller, and pretend they were fair all along,” I said. “Either way, you breathe.”

“And you?” she said.

“I’ll be where I can see you without being in the room.”

She nodded. “You always were good at that.”

The phone rang and kept ringing. She didn’t move.

“Go on,” I said.

She picked it up. Listened. “We’re open at four.” She hung up and wiped her hand on her apron.

“Red’s man,” she said. “He likes to hear his own echo.”

“He’ll hear it less when the placards go up.”

“You sure?”

“No,” I said. “But I like our odds better when we look like we belong.”

She smiled once. Then she didn’t.

I drove the last screw. The door felt like it might not be the first thing to give now.

On the way out I looked at the jukebox counter without touching it. 146. The number moved when the room did. That’s how it should be.

Outside, the wind met me at the corner. The river threw cold up the hill. Streets were the same. Faces weren’t. I pulled the collar up.

You come home and the city takes your measure. If you’re smart, you let it. Then you go to work.
