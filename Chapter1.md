# Chapter 1 — Broken Stool — Midweek Collection

The jukebox man smiled like a dentist. It didn’t reach his eyes.

Tuesday was quiet. Snow at the curb, slush at the door. Maggie stood at the end of the bar with a dish towel and a look that said no foolishness.

The radiator clanked twice and gave up. Steam found the windows and stayed there. The room smelled like coffee, bleach, and last night’s rye.

I took the service door and watched the room in the back bar mirror. Two men by the window, coats open. One at the corner stool with his thumb on the counter like a ledger. The one with the smile had the key ring and a union pin. He liked the weight of both.

They worked the jukebox like it belonged to them. He turned the key, slid the box, counted into his palm. His partner watched the door and liked being seen doing it. I watched his partner’s shoes. Salt crust, city blocks. Not much walking. More standing. He liked to lean.

Maggie poured coffee for a man on lunch and set the mug down before he asked. She kept her hands busy and her face still. I watched the little glass window on the coin box. The numbers said one thing. The smile paid out on another.

He shorted her twenty dollars and a stool. The stool went when his partner leaned on it and kept leaning. It dropped an inch, then another, then died. The partner laughed. The smile didn’t.

“You the union?” he said without looking at me.

“Just a neighbor,” I said.

“Then drink your beer, neighbor.” He flicked a nickel at the tip jar and missed by a hand. He wanted the miss seen.

The partner looked back at the door. He liked the job too much. You could read it in his shoulders.

Maggie put the towel down. “We’re square,” she said. “Take your cut and go.”

“We’re square,” the smile said, and tucked the cash. He put the broken stool under his arm like a favor he’d done. They went out together with the stool and the cold. The door shut. The room breathed. The lunch man looked at his plate like it had done him wrong. He left a dime and stepped into the weather. Maggie didn’t touch the dime.

“You shouldn’t talk to them,” Maggie said.

“I didn’t,” I said. “I opened my mouth.”

She almost smiled. “You said you were done with all that.”

“I was,” I said. “Then I came home.”

She set the towel by the register and looked at the door like it might open again. It didn’t. The clock over the mirror ticked. “How much?” I asked.

She looked at the counter window. Then at the cash she hadn’t been handed. “Twenty,” she said. “Sometimes ten. Sometimes nothing. Depends on who’s counting.” She poured coffee and put it in front of me, not whiskey. That told me two things. She wanted a favor. She wanted me alive to do it.

“You got a man for that?” I said, nodding at the dead stool.

“You’re looking at the man.” She picked up the pieces. “Red’s crew will send a boy next week to fix what they broke. He’ll charge me for the part twice and for the call once. If I say a word, I get a new crack in a different chair.”

“Red Malloy,” I said.

“You know him?”

“I know his type.”

I watched the door mirror until the street settled. Then I watched the pin on the floor where the partner had stood. Union button. The clutch had slipped. I set it on the bar. She didn’t touch it.

“You got your cabaret stamp up?” I asked.

“Waiting on it,” she said. “Inspector said come back when it’s stamped. Counter says backlog.”

“Which window?”

“Three.”

I nodded. Window Three meant a man named Klein who sold timing. You can buy timing. It’s cheaper than friends and reads cleaner later.

“You going to tell me to keep my head down?” she said.

“I’m going to tell you to stand in the right line,” I said. “And to post what the City gives you where a certain kind of man can see it.” She looked at my coat. It didn’t fit yet. Two and a half years will do that. Ribs still talked on stairs.

“You working again?” she said.

“I’m breathing,” I said. “Working comes after that.” She didn’t press. That told me something else. She had pride left. She was spending it where it mattered.

“Help me with the back, then,” she said. “Door sticks when it’s cold.”

We went through the kitchen. The grill was quiet. The icebox cleared its throat. The back door had a good lock and bad screws. Soft metal. I put my shoulder to it and listened. The strike was off by a quarter. The hinge had play.

“Who put the lock on?”

“Red’s boy,” she said, and pressed her lips like she wished she hadn’t.

“I’ll bring wood screws tomorrow,” I said. “These will tear out if a man leans.”

“Red’s men lean,” she said.

“They do,” I said.

A delivery kid tramped in from the alley with crates that smelled like oranges and wet wood. He set them down and blew into his gloves. He kept his eyes low when he saw me. When he saw Maggie, he squared up. “You sign?” he said.

Maggie signed. The kid left the way he came. His footprints doubled the ones he’d made coming in. The cold closed the door behind him.

Back in the bar, the jukebox clicked and didn’t start. She looked at it like it had betrayed her. “It’s a Wurlitzer,” she said. “Red’s man says parts are slow.”

“Parts are fast if you ask for the right thing,” I said. I took the back off with two screws and looked. The motor hummed wrong. A belt had a shine where it shouldn’t. I eased it off, cleaned the pulley, set a new belt from a bag I kept for work I didn’t do anymore. The motor changed when it caught. Lower. “Pick one,” I said.

She pressed B-7. The arm moved. The needle found the groove. Brass and strings filled the room. Not much. Enough. She listened. She didn’t smile.

The phone on the wall rang once and stopped. She watched it the way you watch a stray dog at your door. “If it’s him, he calls at closing,” she said. “He likes the sound of an empty room.”

“We’re not open,” I said, and pulled the plug from the wall. “You don’t have to answer a man who likes the echo.” She breathed out.

“You still got people downtown?” she said.

“I’ve got a man who sells the clock,” I said. “He prefers daylight.”

“You want money?”

“I want the room to stay quiet,” I said. “Money sits fine on top of that.” She put a small cash box on the bar and set her hand on it.

“For parts,” she said.

“I’ll bring receipts,” I said.

“You don’t have to.”

“I do,” I said. “Optics over pride.”

The door opened and let the cold in. No men. Just the wind. Maggie looked anyway. Then she set the towel square by the register like she was posting a notice. “You’ll tell me tomorrow,” she said. “What line. What window. What time.”

“Tomorrow,” I said. “Nine forty-five. City-County. Window three. You wear a clean dress and don’t say a name unless a man asks twice.”

“And you?”

“I’ll fix your back door,” I said. “And stand where the room can see me.” She nodded.

“Johnny,” she said when I reached the door.

“Maggie.”

“You really done with all that?” She meant the smile and the pin and the habit of counting other people’s money.

“I’m done bleeding for it,” I said. The song ended. The room held the last note a second and then let it go.

I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette I didn’t want. The wind followed me to the corner and stopped. Trucks on the Strip. The river under ice. A streetcar ground past and threw sparks where ice met wire. A pair of boys skated their shoes along the gutter and laughed like they owned the block. They didn’t. Not yet.

I walked the frontage and looked back through the window. Maggie wiped the bar in straight lines. The jukebox light made a soft square on the floor. The broken stool leaned against the coat tree like a man who’d had enough.

I didn’t sleep long when I slept. In the morning, I’d say the words I always said before I let another man set the pace for me. Count daylight.

When I came back in, the lunch rush that wasn’t had ended. A man from the paper left a stack by the door and a wet footprint by the mat. Headline said something about a councilman and a paving contract. It always did. “Who owned this place before you?” I said.

“My uncle,” she said. “He died last spring. I bought out my cousins. They got the house. I got the bar and his debts.”

“He leave you friends?”

“A kind,” she said. “Men who remember when he poured heavy.”

“Men like Red?”

“Red remembers everything when it’s useful.”

I nodded. I’d known her uncle. Not well. The bar had a heart that didn’t quit. The register did when a man leaned. “You post a schedule?” I said.

“Wednesday and Friday,” she said. “They like rhythm.”

“Good,” I said. “So do I.” The radiator tried again. The windows fogged, then cleared a little. A river whistle made the glasses on the back bar sing.

“You hungry?” Maggie said.

“No,” I said. “Not for food.”

“Say when you need to run,” she said. “I can handle the room.”

“I’m not running,” I said. “I’m walking where the room can see me.” We didn’t say what that meant. The men at the window would come back, and a different man would come after. One with tin and a car that idled like it belonged to the taxpayers.

A Plymouth idled halfway down the block. I saw the plume before I saw the car. The driver watched the door, not me. Tin rode his wallet like a passenger. I stepped out. He didn’t look. He waited until I stood where my breath fogged his window.

“Byrne,” he said, eyes on his windshield. “Tell the lady she’s late for her recheck.”

“Who are you?”

“The man who makes late go away.” He tapped the wallet. “City likes rhythm. Wednesday, Friday. A cabaret stamp helps. So do friends.” He smiled at the glass. All teeth.

“Name,” I said.

“Dugan,” he said. “Sergeant. We’ll talk.” He pulled off slow. The river smell came back to fill the space he left.

I went inside to tell Maggie she had a friend. And a problem.
