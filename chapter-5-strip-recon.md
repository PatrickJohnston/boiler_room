Draft

Steam rose out of a grate and made its own weather at the corner. The Strip did that—took what the river gave it and pushed it back as breath.

Vic carried the bag. Rags, belts, fuses. A file wrapped in an oil cloth. Nothing that would look wrong if a man asked what was in it and everything we needed if no one did.

“Radio men,” he said.

“Service call,” I said. “You watch the room.”

We started at a supper club on Penn that promised music on weekends and soup every day. Noon crowd. Coats on hooks. A manager with a pencil mustache and a white shirt that had never seen a second shift.

“Radio’s got a hum,” Vic told him, and tapped the jukebox cabinet like an old friend. He didn’t try the lock. He didn’t have to. Men who mind rooms mind money first; the hum could wait.

We took a table where the counter window caught the light when a man bent the right way. Coffee came black and fast. The manager made the rounds, said three names, pocketed two tips and wrote nothing down. He liked to look like he remembered. The trick works until it doesn’t.

A pair of Red’s boys came in at one twelve like they’d made the time the night before and were proud of keeping it. One had the union pin. The other had a small ledger he kept low. They went straight to the cabinet and didn’t order.

I watched the little glass window. The number was a square wheel click. It sat on 212 when the pin man slid the coin box. He counted in his palm, put most in a bag, kept some visible for the table, and wrote 150 in the book the way a man writes a lie he’s told before.

The manager stood close enough to smell it and didn’t. He was busy remembering a name he hadn’t learned.

“Ear,” Vic said under his breath.

I touched my ear. We don’t say it twice. He watched the room again.

The pin man peeled off bills for the payout with a touch of reluctance, the kind that reads like fairness if you don’t know counters. He made a show of adding a dollar for the soup. The manager laughed like he was in on something and wasn’t.

We finished the coffee and left a nickel on the saucer. Service men leave small and regular. It looks like a habit and not a choice.

Outside, the steam had thinned. Trucks out of the wholesalers took the street mean and honest. We crossed behind them and took a narrow door two buildings down—a bar that changed its name twice a year and never its floor.

The bartender wore sleeves and a watch that didn’t fit his wrist. He cleaned a spot that didn’t need it and looked at the door every time it opened. Not skittish. Counting.

“We got a service call for the radio,” I said. “Owner said it hissed when it got warm.”

He shrugged. “You got a ticket?”

Vic took a blank card from his pocket and showed him the back. Men look at the front when they plan to say no and the back when they plan to let you. He let us.

We didn’t touch the cabinet. I took a stool where the mirror behind the bottles cut the room into angles. Vic stood where he could see the door and not be in it.

A man at the pay phone turned toward the wall to talk to no one and pretended not to see us. He had cheap rubber on his shoes and a shine someone else had put there. He was not a customer.

At one fifty-three the door opened and a collector with shoulders like he’d been carrying his job too long came in alone. No pin. No ledger. Just a key ring and a jaw. He worked fast, wrote nothing, and held his body between the cabinet and the room like we couldn’t see through him.

The bartender drifted close and tried to read the number the way men try to read the future. He failed at both.

The collector paid out on a round number. The window didn’t show a round number when he closed it. I kept my face where it belonged.

“Watch,” Vic said softly.

I coughed. The collector looked up and saw a man with a bad coat and a service bag and decided we were furniture. He left a beer untasted on the bar like a receipt and went out without looking back. The pay phone man waited three breaths and followed.

“Rail,” Vic said a minute later when a third man took the end and put his elbow on the wood like he owned it.

I counted rails. Three men at the rail means a smoke walk. We took our coats outside and lit cigarettes we didn’t want. The cold bit my ribs and I let it. The street read us and went back to work.

“COUNT DAYLIGHT?” Vic asked.

“Not yet,” I said. “They’re not here for us. They’re here for rhythm.”

We walked two more rooms for the price of four coffees. A lunch counter with a Wurlitzer that stuck on ballads. A club with a stage big enough for a band on weekends and too big for the band it had. Same faces different places. The pin showed twice and the jaw once. The ledger stayed low. The numbers didn’t match the money when the room wasn’t looking. They never do when a man thinks he owns a neighborhood.

We didn’t talk about it in the rooms. We talked about it on a loading dock that smelled like oranges and rope. Vic set the bag down and put both hands in his pockets.

“Three days,” he said. “Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. Supper club pays on Saturday to look flush. Lanes on Wednesday to look busy. Gin mill on Friday because the paychecks land.”

“One line each,” I said. “We don’t run all three. We watch the clock. We learn who carries which key.”

He grinned. “Buckets live on Saturday.”

“Buckets get you noticed,” I said. “We need leverage, not applause.”

He looked out at the trucks and the men moving them. “You hear yourself? You sound like a man who found a creed.”

“I found a price,” I said. “We keep the room quiet and let the building do the work.”

He nodded. He didn’t like it. He accepted it.

At the end of the block, a tailor with a radio in his window fiddled with the antenna while a race call chased its own tail. The news came late. People listened like it was live.

We went back into the supper club at two twenty-eight because men who make schedules also make mistakes. The pin was there again. So was the manager with the white shirt and the memory that needed help.

He looked at us and looked away. We were furniture again. That’s where we wanted to be.

The counter window said 224 now. The payout ledger would say something else by supper. I touched my ear. Vic didn’t have to look to know why.

We left a card with a phone number that would ring a store where nobody answered. Service men leave numbers. It reassures a certain kind of manager.

Let him read us, not hear us.

On the walk back toward the river the wind took the steam and the day with it. Vic swung the bag light.

“They’re soft,” he said.

“They’re proud,” I said. “Proud reads soft.”

He laughed once. “Pick your room,” he said. “First hit.”

“North Side lanes,” I said. “Service call. One cabinet, one switch down the line when the building says yes.”

“Saturday?”

“Not Saturday.”

He let that sit.

At the corner a man in a clean hat crossed against the light without looking. The trolley bell hit and stopped. The city kept its pace.

We had what we needed: times, keys, a room that paid attention to the wrong thing. We hadn’t touched a lock. Good.

The Strip breathed behind us. We let it. Then we went to work.
