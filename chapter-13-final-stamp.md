# Chapter 13 — Final Stamp

Hook
- Concrete image: The new labels lay under a dictionary on the bar to keep them flat. The ink dried obedient. The City clock said Monday.

Beat goals
- Finish labeling; Ms. Hart’s second inspection; adjunct permit signed and posted.
- Consultant tries once more; rebuffed. Dugan checks the rails, stays hands-off.
- Two counter beats total: quiet reference to Penn’s counter vs payout; chain ledger alignment with City copy.
- One aphorism; one motif touch.
- End on a turn: Accounts moves on Red—reconciliation notice routed; pressure shifts.

Notes
- Target: 1,100–1,300 words
- Motif: city as metronome

Draft

We printed the titles the way you lay out a will—clean, no flourishes, no chance for argument. Maggie set the strips on the bar under a dictionary that had belonged to somebody’s father. The paper took the weight and behaved.

“Spelling?” she said.

“Right enough,” I said.

She lifted the book. The labels lay flat and ready. I peeled one, then another, and we worked the slots until the machine read like a ledger.

Dugan came at nine and didn’t come in. He looked through the glass at the labels the way a man looks at clean shoes. He tapped two fingers on the window frame and went back to watching nothing happen.

“You still won’t take coffee?” Maggie called.

“I’ll take neat,” he said, and drifted to the corner where the light didn’t reach. He liked it there.

At nine thirty I opened the chain ledger and matched it against the copy Ms. Hart had left. Numbers where numbers go. Signatures where signatures live. Men make trouble. Paper makes order.

That was the aphorism. I let it be one and shut up.

“Penn?” Maggie said.

“Two-oh-seven on the glass,” I said. “They paid one ninety-eight again and liked pretending it was generosity.”

She wrote it down without comment. She didn’t write the part where the jaw nearly took Vic’s hand off. We keep the cost in the bones and the numbers on the page.

Ms. Hart arrived at ten with the same bag and a different expression. She looked less like a cop and more like a teacher who wanted you to pass.

“Labels,” she said.

Maggie opened the box smooth. Every slot had a typed name that held its shape.

Ms. Hart nodded. “Selections are legible. No obscenity. No handwritten substitutions.”

“No obscene songs,” Maggie said. “We don’t get that kind of crowd.”

“You’d be surprised what passes for obscene,” Ms. Hart said, and marked a line on her sheet. “Chain ledger?”

I handed it over. She put our copy beside hers and went line by line like a tailor checks a seam. “Consistent,” she said. “Observation clean.”

The consultant came in on a draft that didn’t belong to the door. He had a new card with the same old name.

“Morning,” he said. “I can walk the fee schedule—”

“No,” Maggie said.

He kept the smile. “City likes a friendly intermediary.”

“City likes procedure,” Ms. Hart said, not looking up. “Procedure is friendly.”

He tried the counter then. “Post once a week instead of daily. Less clutter on the glass.”

“Post daily,” Ms. Hart said. “It keeps men honest.”

He looked at me for help. I watched the clock. The city took a breath and gave it back.

“Adjunct is approved,” Ms. Hart said. She stamped the top copy with a seal that didn’t ask permission. The sound had weight. She signed with a steady hand. “Post this high, center.”

Maggie took the certificate like a woman receiving a child. She went to the window and set it where the stamp lived. The glass held both without complaint.

“Any changes to selections require notice,” Ms. Hart said. “Counters turned over Mondays at four. Observation continues for one month.”

“Understood,” I said.

Dugan opened the door long enough to smell the ink and the dust and approve them with a look. “Congratulations,” he said to the room. “You made a jukebox respectable. What’s next, getting married?”

“Not to you,” Maggie said.

He let the door fall back to almost closed and left it there. He listened to the hallway like it had secrets.

The consultant tried one last angle. “Adjuncts can share in a neighborhood fund, discretionary—”

“Out,” Ms. Hart said. It wasn’t loud. It didn’t have to be.

He took the hint and the air changed after him.

Ms. Hart put a second sheet on the bar. “Accounts asked for this,” she said. “It’s a reconciliation notice. Outbound.”

“Outbound where?” I said.

She tapped the header. “Malloy’s office.”

Maggie looked at me and then at the certificate on the glass. “That going to hurt us?”

“It’s not about us,” Ms. Hart said. “It’s about a spread that doesn’t match across rooms.”

We had our first counter beat in the open, and it wasn’t ours to argue. I kept my face still.

She finished her notes. “Post. Keep it neat. If a man in a gray coat comes in with fresh paper, call me.”

“We will,” I said.

She left with less sound than she brought in. Dugan’s shadow peeled off the wall and followed her down the block far enough to make a point and not far enough to be a date.

We posted the certificate above the stamp and stepped back. The window read like a sermon.

Vic came in with his hand wrapped in a clean towel. He tried to smile and didn’t make it all the way.

“Sunday night they put the lock on DeMarco’s right after close,” he said. “This morning they posted a notice that the lock is voluntary pending review.”

“Voluntary,” I said.

“Men like that volunteer other people’s doors,” he said.

“We leave it,” I said. “They can learn on their own wood for once.”

He looked like he wanted to argue. He didn’t. He watched the certificate take the light and nodded at the labels like they’d been waiting for his approval.

At noon the phone rang twice and stopped. Accounts has a rhythm when it calls. It called again and stayed on the line.

“Palmer,” Maggie said.

A man with office air. “Confirming weekly counter turnover at four beginning today,” he said. “And noting outbound reconciliation memo to Malloy Office. For our sheets.”

“For your sheets,” Maggie said. She hung up and looked at the ledger like it might bite.

“Paper’s moving,” she said.

“Good,” I said. “Let it run.”

The city kept its beat outside. Trucks climbed the hill in time. The radio came in a breath late and didn’t apologize. The metronome doesn’t.

At three fifty we put the totals in an envelope and wrote the time on the flap. Maggie licked it shut like an oath. I walked it to City with my ribs complaining just enough to be heard.

Ms. Hart took the envelope herself at the desk. “On time,” she said.

“We try,” I said.

She slid a copy of the reconciliation memo across the counter like a bartender with a check. “You didn’t see this here,” she said. “But if you hear laments in the neighborhood, now you know what music’s playing.”

The memo said what we already understood. Accounts wanted to know why numbers bent when the stamp stood straight. It had three rooms listed and a space after Malloy’s name where a signature should live. It didn’t.

I didn’t smile. “Understood.”

Back at the bar the late light got lazy on the glass and the certificate held it like a catcher’s mitt. Maggie wiped a nonexistent smudge from the corner and left it cleaner anyway.

“DeMarco?” she said.

“We let it be,” I said. “For now.”

“Red won’t like the memo.”

“Red doesn’t like arithmetic,” I said. “It likes him less.”

We locked up early enough to see the street before it turned into something else. Across the alley the new padlock at DeMarco’s caught the last light and threw it back ugly. Our door showed holes where the wrong screws had been and no fresh metal. I liked our door better.

Inside, the machine looked new just because it told the truth. Not loud. Just honest. The certificate said so in black ink and carbon.

Turn
- Adjunct permit approved and posted; labels complete; observation continues with weekly Monday counters.
- Accounts reconciliation memo to Malloy’s office noted; pressure shifts toward Red.
- DeMarco’s padlock left as contrast; decision to let City work before breaking wood.
