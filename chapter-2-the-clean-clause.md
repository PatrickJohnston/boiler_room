Draft

The towel went into a neat square. Maggie set it by the register and looked at the door like it might open again. It didn’t.

“You want help,” I said.

She nodded. “You already started.”

“I opened my mouth,” I said. “That’s not a plan.”

“It sounds like one when you do it.”

I kept my hands where she could see them. “Terms,” I said. “No blood. No kids. No burn on civilians.”

“That it?”

“It’s the only thing that costs.”

She thought about that. The clock over the mirror ticked.

“Red Malloy’s men will come back,” she said. “They’ll ask who you are.”

“They’ll decide what I am,” I said. “We keep it small and straight. You post what the City gives you. I fix your radios and the stool.”

“The City?”

“Cabaret stamp. Amusement decals.” I kept it to the words that mattered. “A man at the counter likes timing better than loyalty.”

“I don’t bribe.”

“You don’t have to. You stand in the right line at the right time. That’s timing. Costs a day’s wages and a clean shirt.”

She watched my face. “You sound like you’ve done it.”

“I’ve watched it done. I know where the ledge is.”

She poured two coffees. She put mine where the broken stool had stood. “No blood,” she said.

“No blood,” I said.

“They shorted me twenty.”

“They short you more when you don’t count,” I said. “We’ll count.”

“That’s two,” she said. “No blood. We count.”

“Three. You don’t talk to Sergeant Dugan without me in the room.”

Her eyes shifted. “He came by,” she said. “Said he could help with the stamp.”

“He can help you lose it,” I said. “Tin likes rent. We’ll pay the City instead.”

She nodded. “You’ll need keys.”

“I’ll make keys.”

“You’ll need to be careful.”

“I’ll be careful.”

The wind pushed under the door and died there. The jukebox clicked and didn’t start.

“It’s a Wurlitzer,” she said. “Red’s man says parts are slow.”

“Parts are fast if you know what to ask for.” I listened. The motor hummed wrong. A belt. “I can make it sing.”

She smiled, small and real. “You a mechanic or a neighbor?”

“I’m the man with the terms.”

We wrote them on a bar napkin. She kept the napkin. I kept a copy in my head.

“Tomorrow,” I said. “You go to the City-County Building at nine forty-five. Window three. Ask for a recheck on an inspector’s note. Don’t say Klein’s name.”

“Who’s Klein?”

“A man who likes to be helpful after lunch.”

She folded the napkin like the towel.

“And you?”

“I’ll fix the radio. I’ll look at your back door and your locks. I’ll stand where the room can see me.”

“You don’t like quiet.”

“I like results.”

She slid the napkin into the register. “No blood,” she said again.

“No blood,” I said. “And when they come back for rhythm, we keep the room steady.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means Wednesday and Friday look normal.”

“You’re going to steal from them,” she said.

“I’m going to tell the truth without talking,” I said.

She didn’t argue. She’d counted too many tills. She brought up a small cash box.

“For parts,” she said.

“I’ll bring receipts,” I said.

“You don’t have to.”

“I do,” I said. “Optics over pride.”

She poured more coffee without asking. The room settled around the sound.

“You ever think about leaving?” she asked.

“I did,” I said. “Then I came home.”

“You’ll call me when you get to the counter,” I said. “If a man named Dugan shows before that, you don’t open your mouth.”

“I’ll keep it shut,” she said. “You’ll open yours.”

“When it buys us something.”

The door creaked. Not a man. The wind.

The back came off with two screws. The belt had a shine where it shouldn’t. I eased it off, cleaned the pulley, set a new belt from my bag. The motor changed its sound when it caught. Lower.

“Pick one,” I said.

She pressed B-7. The arm moved. The needle found the groove. Brass and strings filled the room. Not much. Enough.

I checked the coin box window. The counter read 142. She’d been paid like it read 110. I didn’t say it.

The phone rang once and stopped.

“We’re not open,” I said, and pulled the plug from the wall.

She breathed out. “Tomorrow at nine forty-five,” she said. “Window three.”

“You’ll call me from the hallway before you step up,” I said. “If a man with tin offers help, you tell him to come back when your partner’s here.”

“You my partner?”

“On paper, no.” I nodded at the napkin. “In the room, yes.”

I walked the back door. Wrong screws. Soft metal. “I’ll bring wood screws tomorrow. These will tear out if a man leans.”

“Red’s men lean,” she said.

“They do,” I said. “We’ll make the door lean back.”

The song ended. The room held the last note and let it go.

A car slowed outside and kept going. “Tomorrow,” I said.

“Tomorrow,” she said.

I put the back on the jukebox and wiped the smudge I’d left on the chrome.

When I left, the wind followed me to the corner and stopped. I tried the coat. It still didn’t fit.

I was at the corner again at nine forty. She was five minutes late and on time. We walked to the City-County without talking. The building had a smell—ink, dust, wet wool.

We took a number and sat. A girl with red nails called names that weren’t ours. Men in hats leaned on the rail. A clock on the wall made a slow meal of ten minutes.

At eleven-fifty-five, the windows changed. The morning clerks vanished. New faces took the stools. Klein came back with a paper sack and mustard on his tie. He looked like a man who liked to be helpful after lunch.

Maggie stood. I stayed in the hall where she could see me. Sergeant Dugan found us anyway.

“Morning,” he said. He wore his tin like a man wears a watch. “You headed to Three?”

Maggie didn’t answer. She looked at me. I looked at Dugan.

“We’re here for a recheck,” I said.

“I can smooth that,” he said. “Save you time.”

“We like time,” I said. “We’ll buy it from the City.”

His smile missed his eyes. “You don’t want to be difficult.”

“I want a stamp on paper and a record in a book,” I said. “You can wave us past the line. You can’t make the stamp stick.”

He weighed that and watched the door to Three. “Window three is a friend of mine.”

“Then we’ll be friends by association,” I said. “My partner will ask for a recheck and a fresh cabaret stamp. She’ll pay the fee. The clerk will punch it. We’ll post it where the room can see it. You can stop by for coffee like always.”

“You’re her partner now?”

“In the room,” I said.

He shifted his weight. “You post it where the wrong eyes can see it, you’ll have trouble.”

“We already have trouble,” I said. “We’re making it simple.”

He nodded once, like a man marking a card. “Simple gets locked up fast.” He let that hang and wandered down the hall.

Maggie put her hands on the counter. Klein took the inspector’s note and didn’t ask questions. He checked a box and walked to the back. When he came back, he had a stamp and a small sheet with serial numbers. He inked the stamp hard and straight.

“Post in view of patrons,” he said. He didn’t look at her. “Recheck clears the note. Keep the sheet.”

Good. Let the glass do the talking.

Maggie slid two dollars and a quarter into the tray. Klein pushed back a receipt. She took it like it might break.

We walked out with the stamp and the sheet. Dugan had gone wherever men like Dugan go at lunch.

Back at the bar, I set the wood screws in the back door. Two-inch brass, deep bite. The hinge stopped talking. The jamb took a set. I put the old soft screws in my pocket so I could throw them away somewhere that wasn’t our alley.

Maggie wiped a spot on the front glass and taped the cabaret stamp where anyone walking past could see it without trying. Above eye level. Dead center. The word CABARET sat in red like a dare.

“Too high?” she asked.

“High is fine,” I said. “Men in cars look up when they slow. Let them see what we paid for.”

She put the serial sheet under the register, on top of the napkin with our terms. She didn’t have to say anything. The room heard the tape tear and settle.

At two-fifteen a Ford eased to the curb. Two men in coats looked in. One of them laughed and shook his head. They didn’t come in. They didn’t have to. Ten minutes later, something tapped the alley door.

I walked back. Nothing on the handle. Nothing on the sill. The mark was on the paint, low and neat. Blue chalk. An X the size of a hand.

Maggie stood behind me. “City?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “City uses paper.”

“What does it mean?”

“It means someone wants a padlock without the paperwork.”

She took a breath and let it out slow. “We have the stamp.”

“We do,” I said. I touched the X and blue dust came away on my finger. “Now we have a clock.”

She didn’t ask how long. She knew the rhythm. Wednesday and Friday looked normal if you didn’t stare at them.

I washed the chalk off my hand and set the latch on the door. The screws held. The hinge held. The room held.

At closing, I put a small card under the front stamp that said PAID. Plain pencil, square letters. Not for the City. For anyone who needed to read.

We turned out the lights. The stamp in the window held the last of the street. It held long enough.
