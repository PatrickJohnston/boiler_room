# The Jukebox Route

By Patrick Johnston

# Chapter 1 — Broken Stool — Midweek Collection

The jukebox man smiled like a dentist. It didn’t reach his eyes.

Tuesday was quiet. Snow at the curb, slush at the door. Maggie stood at the end of the bar with a dish towel and a look that said no foolishness.

The radiator clanked twice and gave up. Steam found the windows and stayed there. The room smelled like coffee, bleach, and last night’s rye.

I took the service door and watched the room in the back bar mirror. Two men by the window, coats open. One at the corner stool with his thumb on the counter like a ledger. The one with the smile had the key ring and a union pin. He liked the weight of both.

They worked the jukebox like it belonged to them. He turned the key, slid the box, counted into his palm. His partner watched the door and liked being seen doing it. I watched his partner’s shoes. Salt crust, city blocks. Not much walking. More standing. He liked to lean.

Maggie poured coffee for a man on lunch and set the mug down before he asked. She kept her hands busy and her face still. I watched the little glass window on the coin box. The numbers said one thing. The smile paid out on another.

He shorted her twenty dollars and a stool. The stool went when his partner leaned on it and kept leaning. It dropped an inch, then another, then died. The partner laughed. The smile didn’t.

“You the union?” he said without looking at me.

“Just a neighbor,” I said.

“Then drink your beer, neighbor.” He flicked a nickel at the tip jar and missed by a hand. He wanted the miss seen.

The partner looked back at the door. He liked the job too much. You could read it in his shoulders.

Maggie put the towel down. “We’re square,” she said. “Take your cut and go.”

“We’re square,” the smile said, and tucked the cash. He put the broken stool under his arm like a favor he’d done. They went out together with the stool and the cold. The door shut. The room breathed. The lunch man looked at his plate like it had done him wrong. He left a dime and stepped into the weather. Maggie didn’t touch the dime.

“You shouldn’t talk to them,” Maggie said.

“I didn’t,” I said. “I opened my mouth.”

She almost smiled. “You said you were done with all that.”

“I was,” I said. “Then I came home.”

She set the towel by the register and looked at the door like it might open again. It didn’t. The clock over the mirror ticked. “How much?” I asked.

She looked at the counter window. Then at the cash she hadn’t been handed. “Twenty,” she said. “Sometimes ten. Sometimes nothing. Depends on who’s counting.” She poured coffee and put it in front of me, not whiskey. That told me two things. She wanted a favor. She wanted me alive to do it.

“You got a man for that?” I said, nodding at the dead stool.

“You’re looking at the man.” She picked up the pieces. “Red’s crew will send a boy next week to fix what they broke. He’ll charge me for the part twice and for the call once. If I say a word, I get a new crack in a different chair.”

“Red Malloy,” I said.

“You know him?”

“I know his type.”

I watched the door mirror until the street settled. Then I watched the pin on the floor where the partner had stood. Union button. The clutch had slipped. I set it on the bar. She didn’t touch it.

“You got your cabaret stamp up?” I asked.

“Waiting on it,” she said. “Inspector said come back when it’s stamped. Counter says backlog.”

“Which window?”

“Three.”

I nodded. Window Three meant a man named Klein who sold timing. You can buy timing. It’s cheaper than friends and reads cleaner later.

“You going to tell me to keep my head down?” she said.

“I’m going to tell you to stand in the right line,” I said. “And to post what the City gives you where a certain kind of man can see it.” She looked at my coat. It didn’t fit yet. Two and a half years will do that. Ribs still talked on stairs.

“You working again?” she said.

“I’m breathing,” I said. “Working comes after that.” She didn’t press. That told me something else. She had pride left. She was spending it where it mattered.

“Help me with the back, then,” she said. “Door sticks when it’s cold.”

We went through the kitchen. The grill was quiet. The icebox cleared its throat. The back door had a good lock and bad screws. Soft metal. I put my shoulder to it and listened. The strike was off by a quarter. The hinge had play.

“Who put the lock on?”

“Red’s boy,” she said, and pressed her lips like she wished she hadn’t.

“I’ll bring wood screws tomorrow,” I said. “These will tear out if a man leans.”

“Red’s men lean,” she said.

“They do,” I said.

A delivery kid tramped in from the alley with crates that smelled like oranges and wet wood. He set them down and blew into his gloves. He kept his eyes low when he saw me. When he saw Maggie, he squared up. “You sign?” he said.

Maggie signed. The kid left the way he came. His footprints doubled the ones he’d made coming in. The cold closed the door behind him.

Back in the bar, the jukebox clicked and didn’t start. She looked at it like it had betrayed her. “It’s a Wurlitzer,” she said. “Red’s man says parts are slow.”

“Parts are fast if you ask for the right thing,” I said. I took the back off with two screws and looked. The motor hummed wrong. A belt had a shine where it shouldn’t. I eased it off, cleaned the pulley, set a new belt from a bag I kept for work I didn’t do anymore. The motor changed when it caught. Lower. “Pick one,” I said.

She pressed B-7. The arm moved. The needle found the groove. Brass and strings filled the room. Not much. Enough. She listened. She didn’t smile.

The phone on the wall rang once and stopped. She watched it the way you watch a stray dog at your door. “If it’s him, he calls at closing,” she said. “He likes the sound of an empty room.”

“We’re not open,” I said, and pulled the plug from the wall. “You don’t have to answer a man who likes the echo.” She breathed out.

“You still got people downtown?” she said.

“I’ve got a man who sells the clock,” I said. “He prefers daylight.”

“You want money?”

“I want the room to stay quiet,” I said. “Money sits fine on top of that.” She put a small cash box on the bar and set her hand on it.

“For parts,” she said.

“I’ll bring receipts,” I said.

“You don’t have to.”

“I do,” I said. “Optics over pride.”

The door opened and let the cold in. No men. Just the wind. Maggie looked anyway. Then she set the towel square by the register like she was posting a notice. “You’ll tell me tomorrow,” she said. “What line. What window. What time.”

“Tomorrow,” I said. “Nine forty-five. City-County. Window three. You wear a clean dress and don’t say a name unless a man asks twice.”

“And you?”

“I’ll fix your back door,” I said. “And stand where the room can see me.” She nodded.

“Johnny,” she said when I reached the door.

“Maggie.”

“You really done with all that?” She meant the smile and the pin and the habit of counting other people’s money.

“I’m done bleeding for it,” I said. The song ended. The room held the last note a second and then let it go.

I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette I didn’t want. The wind followed me to the corner and stopped. Trucks on the Strip. The river under ice. A streetcar ground past and threw sparks where ice met wire. A pair of boys skated their shoes along the gutter and laughed like they owned the block. They didn’t. Not yet.

I walked the frontage and looked back through the window. Maggie wiped the bar in straight lines. The jukebox light made a soft square on the floor. The broken stool leaned against the coat tree like a man who’d had enough.

I didn’t sleep long when I slept. In the morning, I’d say the words I always said before I let another man set the pace for me. Count daylight.

When I came back in, the lunch rush that wasn’t had ended. A man from the paper left a stack by the door and a wet footprint by the mat. Headline said something about a councilman and a paving contract. It always did. “Who owned this place before you?” I said.

“My uncle,” she said. “He died last spring. I bought out my cousins. They got the house. I got the bar and his debts.”

“He leave you friends?”

“A kind,” she said. “Men who remember when he poured heavy.”

“Men like Red?”

“Red remembers everything when it’s useful.”

I nodded. I’d known her uncle. Not well. The bar had a heart that didn’t quit. The register did when a man leaned. “You post a schedule?” I said.

“Wednesday and Friday,” she said. “They like rhythm.”

“Good,” I said. “So do I.” The radiator tried again. The windows fogged, then cleared a little. A river whistle made the glasses on the back bar sing.

“You hungry?” Maggie said.

“No,” I said. “Not for food.”

“Say when you need to run,” she said. “I can handle the room.”

“I’m not running,” I said. “I’m walking where the room can see me.” We didn’t say what that meant. The men at the window would come back, and a different man would come after. One with tin and a car that idled like it belonged to the taxpayers.

A Plymouth idled halfway down the block. I saw the plume before I saw the car. The driver watched the door, not me. Tin rode his wallet like a passenger. I stepped out. He didn’t look. He waited until I stood where my breath fogged his window.

“Byrne,” he said, eyes on his windshield. “Tell the lady she’s late for her recheck.”

“Who are you?”

“The man who makes late go away.” He tapped the wallet. “City likes rhythm. Wednesday, Friday. A cabaret stamp helps. So do friends.” He smiled at the glass. All teeth.

“Name,” I said.

“Dugan,” he said. “Sergeant. We’ll talk.” He pulled off slow. The river smell came back to fill the space he left.

I went inside to tell Maggie she had a friend. And a problem.

###

# Chapter 2 — The Clean Clause

The towel went into a neat square. Maggie set it by the register and looked at the door like it might open again. It didn’t.

“You want help,” I said.

She nodded. “You already started.”

“I opened my mouth,” I said. “That’s not a plan.”

“It sounds like one when you do it.”

I kept my hands where she could see them. “Terms,” I said. “No blood. No kids. No burn on civilians.”

“That it?”

“It’s the only thing that costs.”

She thought about that. The clock over the mirror ticked.

“Red Malloy’s men will come back,” she said. “They’ll ask who you are.”

“They’ll decide what I am,” I said. “We keep it small and straight. You post what the City gives you. I fix your radios and the stool.”

“The City?”

“Cabaret stamp. Amusement decals.” I kept it to the words that mattered. “A man at the counter likes timing better than loyalty.”

“I don’t bribe.”

“You don’t have to. You stand in the right line at the right time. That’s timing. Costs a day’s wages and a clean shirt.”

She watched my face. “You sound like you’ve done it.”

“I’ve watched it done. I know where the ledge is.”

She poured two coffees. She put mine where the broken stool had stood. “No blood,” she said.

“No blood,” I said.

“They shorted me twenty.”

“They short you more when you don’t count,” I said. “We’ll count.”

“That’s two,” she said. “No blood. We count.”

“Three. You don’t talk to Sergeant Dugan without me in the room.”

Her eyes shifted. “He came by,” she said. “Said he could help with the stamp.”

“He can help you lose it,” I said. “Tin likes rent. We’ll pay the City instead.”

She nodded. “You’ll need keys.”

“I’ll make keys.”

“You’ll need to be careful.”

“I’ll be careful.”

The wind pushed under the door and died there. The jukebox clicked and didn’t start.

“It’s a Wurlitzer,” she said. “Red’s man says parts are slow.”

“Parts are fast if you know what to ask for.” I listened. The motor hummed wrong. A belt. “I can make it sing.”

She smiled, small and real. “You a mechanic or a neighbor?”

“I’m the man with the terms.”

We wrote them on a bar napkin. She kept the napkin. I kept a copy in my head.

“Tomorrow,” I said. “You go to the City-County Building at nine forty-five. Window three. Ask for a recheck on an inspector’s note. Don’t say Klein’s name.”

“Who’s Klein?”

“A man who likes to be helpful after lunch.”

She folded the napkin like the towel.

“And you?”

“I’ll fix the radio. I’ll look at your back door and your locks. I’ll stand where the room can see me.”

“You don’t like quiet.”

“I like results.”

She slid the napkin into the register. “No blood,” she said again.

“No blood,” I said. “And when they come back for rhythm, we keep the room steady.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means Wednesday and Friday look normal.”

“You’re going to steal from them,” she said.

“I’m going to tell the truth without talking,” I said.

She didn’t argue. She’d counted too many tills. She brought up a small cash box.

“For parts,” she said.

“I’ll bring receipts,” I said.

“You don’t have to.”

“I do,” I said. “Optics over pride.”

She poured more coffee without asking. The room settled around the sound.

“You ever think about leaving?” she asked.

“I did,” I said. “Then I came home.”

“You’ll call me when you get to the counter,” I said. “If a man named Dugan shows before that, you don’t open your mouth.”

“I’ll keep it shut,” she said. “You’ll open yours.”

“When it buys us something.”

The door creaked. Not a man. The wind.

The back came off with two screws. The belt had a shine where it shouldn’t. I eased it off, cleaned the pulley, set a new belt from my bag. The motor changed its sound when it caught. Lower.

“Pick one,” I said.

She pressed B-7. The arm moved. The needle found the groove. Brass and strings filled the room. Not much. Enough.

I checked the coin box window. The counter read 142. She’d been paid like it read 110. I didn’t say it.

The phone rang once and stopped.

“We’re not open,” I said, and pulled the plug from the wall.

She breathed out. “Tomorrow at nine forty-five,” she said. “Window three.”

“You’ll call me from the hallway before you step up,” I said. “If a man with tin offers help, you tell him to come back when your partner’s here.”

“You my partner?”

“On paper, no.” I nodded at the napkin. “In the room, yes.”

I walked the back door. Wrong screws. Soft metal. “I’ll bring wood screws tomorrow. These will tear out if a man leans.”

“Red’s men lean,” she said.

“They do,” I said. “We’ll make the door lean back.”

The song ended. The room held the last note and let it go.

A car slowed outside and kept going. “Tomorrow,” I said.

“Tomorrow,” she said.

I put the back on the jukebox and wiped the smudge I’d left on the chrome.

When I left, the wind followed me to the corner and stopped. I tried the coat. It still didn’t fit.

I was at the corner again at nine forty. She was five minutes late and on time. We walked to the City-County without talking. The building had a smell—ink, dust, wet wool.

We took a number and sat. A girl with red nails called names that weren’t ours. Men in hats leaned on the rail. A clock on the wall made a slow meal of ten minutes.

At eleven-fifty-five, the windows changed. The morning clerks vanished. New faces took the stools. Klein came back with a paper sack and mustard on his tie. He looked like a man who liked to be helpful after lunch.

Maggie stood. I stayed in the hall where she could see me. Sergeant Dugan found us anyway.

“Morning,” he said. He wore his tin like a man wears a watch. “You headed to Three?”

Maggie didn’t answer. She looked at me. I looked at Dugan.

“We’re here for a recheck,” I said.

“I can smooth that,” he said. “Save you time.”

“We like time,” I said. “We’ll buy it from the City.”

His smile missed his eyes. “You don’t want to be difficult.”

“I want a stamp on paper and a record in a book,” I said. “You can wave us past the line. You can’t make the stamp stick.”

He weighed that and watched the door to Three. “Window three is a friend of mine.”

“Then we’ll be friends by association,” I said. “My partner will ask for a recheck and a fresh cabaret stamp. She’ll pay the fee. The clerk will punch it. We’ll post it where the room can see it. You can stop by for coffee like always.”

“You’re her partner now?”

“In the room,” I said.

He shifted his weight. “You post it where the wrong eyes can see it, you’ll have trouble.”

“We already have trouble,” I said. “We’re making it simple.”

He nodded once, like a man marking a card. “Simple gets locked up fast.” He let that hang and wandered down the hall.

Maggie put her hands on the counter. Klein took the inspector’s note and didn’t ask questions. He checked a box and walked to the back. When he came back, he had a stamp and a small sheet with serial numbers. He inked the stamp hard and straight.

“Post in view of patrons,” he said. He didn’t look at her. “Recheck clears the note. Keep the sheet.”

Good. Let the glass do the talking.

Maggie slid two dollars and a quarter into the tray. Klein pushed back a receipt. She took it like it might break.

We walked out with the stamp and the sheet. Dugan had gone wherever men like Dugan go at lunch.

Back at the bar, I set the wood screws in the back door. Two-inch brass, deep bite. The hinge stopped talking. The jamb took a set. I put the old soft screws in my pocket so I could throw them away somewhere that wasn’t our alley.

Maggie wiped a spot on the front glass and taped the cabaret stamp where anyone walking past could see it without trying. Above eye level. Dead center. The word CABARET sat in red like a dare.

“Too high?” she asked.

“High is fine,” I said. “Men in cars look up when they slow. Let them see what we paid for.”

She put the serial sheet under the register, on top of the napkin with our terms. She didn’t have to say anything. The room heard the tape tear and settle.

At two-fifteen a Ford eased to the curb. Two men in coats looked in. One of them laughed and shook his head. They didn’t come in. They didn’t have to. Ten minutes later, something tapped the alley door.

I walked back. Nothing on the handle. Nothing on the sill. The mark was on the paint, low and neat. Blue chalk. An X the size of a hand.

Maggie stood behind me. “City?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “City uses paper.”

“What does it mean?”

“It means someone wants a padlock without the paperwork.”

She took a breath and let it out slow. “We have the stamp.”

“We do,” I said. I touched the X and blue dust came away on my finger. “Now we have a clock.”

She didn’t ask how long. She knew the rhythm. Wednesday and Friday looked normal if you didn’t stare at them.

I washed the chalk off my hand and set the latch on the door. The screws held. The hinge held. The room held.

At closing, I put a small card under the front stamp that said PAID. Plain pencil, square letters. Not for the City. For anyone who needed to read.

We turned out the lights. The stamp in the window held the last of the street. It held long enough.

###

# Chapter 3 — Rearview

The wind got under the service door and lifted the mat. Maggie put a chair on it and went back to her bottles. I shrugged into the coat. It still didn’t fit.

I walked. Penn to the bridge, then the North Side up and over like I used to. Trucks worked the Strip. Steam rose out of grates and made its own weather at the corner.

Two and a half changes a man. You carry it in your shoulders and in the way stairs feel when the cold gets into your bones. Leavenworth was a place. Pittsburgh was the cost.

At the first block I passed a barber with a radio on. The announcer ran scores like a man late for a train. I didn’t know the team anymore. I knew the ad that followed—soap, cigarettes, one car brand telling you about another. The city liked noise. It liked rhythm.

A kid shoveled a stoop and watched me pass. Not curious. Accounting. Coats read like ledgers. Mine said out-of-town, even when it wasn’t.

I took the iron stairs behind a lane to save a block. Ribs talked on the second flight. I kept going. On the landing, two men smoked. They moved just enough for me to slip by and made me feel the space they’d given.

“You from around here?” one said.

“I used to be,” I said.

He looked at my hands. The other one looked at my shoes. They nodded to each other like I’d answered a different question.

On Federal, the butcher’s window was new, the man behind it wasn’t. He’d lost hair and kept his stance. He raised the knife like a hello and went back to the bone.

The City-County Building sat across the river like a dare. I stood where I could see the windows without counting them. You don’t win at the counter; you time it.

I crossed at the light and cut through a lobby that smelled like wet wool and paper. The guard read his newspaper until a man with a hat too clean made him fold it. The hat took the elevator like it belonged to him. I took the stairs. Third flight asked me what I was made of.

In the permits hall, a line had already decided who was important. Men with folders. Women with patience. A clerk with a face made for no. Klein was at Window Three. He had a pencil behind his ear and the look of a man who enjoyed moving a problem an inch at a time.

I didn’t step up. I watched the clock. I watched a messenger with a leather bag drop a stack and get a nod past rules the rest of us had to follow. I watched a secretary bring coffee that didn’t spill. The building ran on timing and small courtesies.

Klein saw me see him and looked away. Good. Men who sell timing don’t like to be stared at. They like to be recognized without the formality of names.

I left without speaking. On the way down I met a man with tin at his belt coming up. He smiled at the railing.

“Morning, Byrne,” he said.

“Sergeant.”

“Tell the lady her recheck looks better if she has a friend.”

“She has one.”

“You?”

“Me.”

He nodded and kept going. He didn’t touch the rail.

Back on Penn, the day had decided to snow. It came small and straight and meant to stay. I walked into it and felt the city set its pace around me. A trolley bell hit and stopped. A man cursed at a truck and the truck won.

I ducked into a diner with coffee and a cracked pie case. The waitress wrote my order before I opened my mouth.

“Cold,” she said.

“It’s January,” I said.

“Feels like February.”

“Worse things feel like February,” I said.

She poured and left me to it. The coffee did its job. A man in a booth shook his head at a headline about a councilman who liked money too much to keep it quiet. I didn’t know his name. I knew his type.

I took the long way back toward Maggie’s. Past a bowling alley where the leagues hung their jackets on nails and a man oiled the lanes with a can on a stick. Past a supper club that promised music on weekends. Past a gin mill where the door never stopped moving on a Friday.

Route man’s eyes came back. Cabinet backs. Locks. Angles. Counters in little windows that told one story while the men with keys told another.

At Maggie’s alley, a set of prints told me I wasn’t the first walk-through. Broad heel, narrow toe, cheap rubber. The kind of shoe a man buys when someone else is paying. They stopped at the back door and turned around. Twice.

The door had the same wrong screws. I put a hand on the jamb and felt the give. I’d brought wood screws. I turned two by hand and felt the door answer different.

Inside, Maggie had the radio low and the register open. She looked up like she’d kept count on my steps.

“How’s the City?” she said.

“Like always,” I said. “If you talk first, you pay twice.”

“I can be quiet.”

“You can. You will.”

She nodded at my coat. “Still not right?”

“It’s getting there.”

“You eat?”

“Coffee.”

She pushed a plate with toast and butter. I ate because she told me to without saying it.

“Dugan?” she said.

“He said he likes friends.”

“He’s not wrong.”

“He’s expensive.”

“You going to tell me what you saw?” she said.

“I saw a man who sells timing,” I said. “He’s on the clock after lunch.”

“I can be there after lunch.”

“You’ll be there at one fifteen. You’ll wait until one twenty-eight. Then you’ll step up and ask for a recheck on an inspector’s note. You won’t say a name.”

“I can do that.”

“If a clean hat goes in ahead of you, you’ll let him. If a messenger drops a stack, you’ll let him. When you step up, you’ll have the form filled and the fee ready. You’ll smile once. Then you won’t.”

She listened like it was a recipe.

“Say it straight,” she said. “What’s the play?”

“We don’t beat them,” I said. “We put the City between us and let Red decide how public he wants to be.”

She watched my face. “Go on.”

“We make the room look like it belongs,” I said. “Stamp on the glass. Serial sheet in the drawer. Receipts where they can be found. Jukebox numbers that add when the man with keys says they should. We don’t whisper. We post.”

“That’s a con?”

“A con’s a story with props,” I said. “Ours is simple: we’re square. If they lean after that, it looks like a shakedown in front of the City. If they want a padlock, they need paperwork. Paperwork leaves fingerprints.”

“You mean we lie.”

“No,” I said. “We make the truth loud. We say nothing and let the glass talk. Men like Red sell fear. We sell time.”

“How?”

“Time is the gap between what is and what looks like it,” I said. “We close that gap on paper and let them feel it. They step over, or they step back.”

“And if they don’t step at all?”

“Then they change the man on the route, skim smaller, and pretend they were fair all along,” I said. “Either way, you breathe.”

“And you?” she said.

“I’ll be where I can see you without being in the room.”

She nodded. “You always were good at that.”

The phone rang and kept ringing. She didn’t move.

“Go on,” I said.

She picked it up. Listened. “We’re open at four.” She hung up and wiped her hand on her apron.

“Red’s man,” she said. “He likes to hear his own echo.”

“He’ll hear it less when the placards go up.”

“You sure?”

“No,” I said. “But I like our odds better when we look like we belong.”

She smiled once. Then she didn’t.

I drove the last screw. The door felt like it might not be the first thing to give now.

On the way out I looked at the jukebox counter without touching it. 146. The number moved when the room did. That’s how it should be.

Outside, the wind met me at the corner. The river threw cold up the hill. Streets were the same. Faces weren’t. I pulled the collar up.

You come home and the city takes your measure. If you’re smart, you let it. Then you go to work.

###

# Chapter 4 — Old Mentor, New Friction


Vic’s hat hit the bar first. Grease on the brim, not from work— from a man who touches the same place when he thinks. Then the hand. Then the grin.

“Johnny Byrne,” he said. “Hell of a thing to see you standing up.”

“It’s easier than the other way,” I said.

We didn’t shake. We bumped shoulders like boys who’d spent a winter stealing coal together. Maggie watched us and poured two coffees without being asked.

“You still take it black?” Vic said.

“I take it,” I said.

He laughed once and let the bar take his weight. He looked around the room like he owned it in a past life and was considering a second try.

“Red’s boys been respectful?” he said.

“They broke a stool,” I said.

“Gentle, then.” He took his coffee, sipped, set it down. No sugar. “You working?”

“I’m helping a neighbor.”

“That what we call it?” He drummed a slow rhythm on the wood with two fingers. “I got a thought. You and me. One for the old days.”

Maggie set a plate of toast between us as if to bless and contain whatever came next.

“What’s the thought,” I said.

“Red’s skim has a cadence,” he said. “He pays short on the lanes on Thursday, makes it up at the club on Saturday, creams the gin mill on Wednesday because the books don’t care about Wednesday. Three hits, one week. Same night if you got the hands. They won’t know where the leak started.”

“Or they read the smoke and call a meeting,” I said. “We’re not running a circus.”

He held up a palm. “Little circus. Buckets for the trouble. You go narrow, you get nickels.”

“I like nickels I can spend,” I said. “Daylight nickels.”

“COUNT DAYLIGHT,” he said, and made it a toast with coffee instead of whiskey. “You always did like a slogan.”

“I like a plan that lives after I do.”

Maggie cleared the plate and left us to it.

“You still got a key man?” Vic said.

“I got a ring and a file,” I said.

“Good.” He tapped his pocket. It clicked. “I brought a twin for Red’s South Side cabinet. Clean work. You won’t find the mark unless you measure brass with a mic.”

“Who cut it?”

“A friend at a bowling alley who owes me shoes,” he said. “He’ll never miss them.”

“You paying him in buckets?”

“In mercy.” He smiled. “He thinks the world is fair.”

I let the smile pass.

“What do you want, Vic.”

“Another run with hands I trust,” he said. “It’s buckets, Johnny. I ain’t got ten winters left for nickels.”

“You got this winter,” I said. “Don’t spend it on pride.”

He watched me. He was measuring me with the same tool he used on locks. “You sound like a man who took a breath he didn’t think he’d get.”

“I did,” I said. “I like to keep it.”

He nodded like that was a fair religion, then leaned in so only the coins could hear us.

“Listen. I run the lanes Wednesday. You and the girl post the placards Thursday. Friday we do the service call at the supper club. Saturday you send your little memo to Falco’s bean-counter about the numbers that don’t match the smile.”

“Too wide,” I said. “One hit. One memo. We build pressure slow.”

He grinned. “You always were a miser.”

“Of noise,” I said.

Maggie came back with a ledger and set it down. “You boys write on paper if you’re going to talk business,” she said. “I like clean ears.”

Vic flipped it open like he’d been waiting for permission. He drew three boxes, wrote days under them, sketched arrows like a man laying track.

“You hear yourself?” I said. “You’re grinning at the ink.”

“I’m grinning at the math,” he said. “Counters don’t lie. Men do.”

“One counter beat,” I said. “Save the second for when it matters.”

He chuckled. “You reading me rules now?”

“I’m keeping you from reading me an obituary.”

He closed the ledger and patted it like a dog. “One hit,” he said, like he could say it without believing it.

“Service call,” I said. “North Side lanes. You carry the bag. I do the hands. You watch the room.”

“You don’t trust me to watch your hands?”

“Not when you enjoy it,” I said. “You stop seeing doors when you watch me.”

He took that and pocketed it. “Fair.”

We set tells. Watch equals cough. Ear equals nickels. Rail over three equals smoke walk. He repeated them until they were muscle.

“You hurt?” he said.

“On stairs,” I said.

“We’ll take the ramp.” He smiled like a promise.

The door opened and two coats came in with red ears. They took the end and pretended to be customers. Vic watched their shoes.

“Red’s,” he said.

I said nothing. He said nothing. Maggie set two beers in front of them and left the change on the wet wood like it didn’t matter. They drank half and left both close to full. They weren’t thirsty.

“You want me to say hello?” Vic said.

“I want you to finish your coffee.”

He finished it.

They left. The room breathed.

“You getting soft?” Vic said.

“I’m getting careful.”

He shook his head once, not angry. “Careful gets you old,” he said. “Old gets you small.”

“Dead gets you nothing,” I said. “Pick two.”

He laughed and slapped the bar. “You still got it.”

“I kept what I needed.”

We walked the route map once without leaving our stools. He named rooms by smells and chairs. I corrected him twice and let him correct me once. He noticed. I let him.

“You call it,” he said finally. “I’ll carry the bag.”

“We do one. We seed one. We sit still and let the building do work for us.”

“And if they hit back?”

“Then we count daylight.”

He made a face at the phrase and still nodded. “Tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow,” I said.

He stood, took his hat, and set it on his head. He looked older when he did it. The grin came back anyway. “You never did let me have the wheel,” he said.

“I hand it to you when the road’s straight,” I said. “This one isn’t.”

“Yet,” he said.

He went out into the cold like it owed him change. I watched him cross the window and disappear. My ribs nudged me for standing too fast. I sat and waited for the room to get quiet again.

Maggie wiped a circle on the bar I hadn’t dirtied. “I like him,” she said.

“I do too,” I said.

“He going to get you hurt?”

“Only if I let him.”

“You won’t,” she said.

“I won’t,” I said, and hoped I wasn’t lying.

# Chapter 5 — Strip Recon

Steam rose out of a grate and made its own weather at the corner. The Strip did that—took what the river gave it and pushed it back as breath.

Vic carried the bag. Rags, belts, fuses. A file wrapped in an oil cloth. Nothing that would look wrong if a man asked what was in it and everything we needed if no one did.

“Radio men,” he said.

“Service call,” I said. “You watch the room.”

We started at a supper club on Penn that promised music on weekends and soup every day. Noon crowd. Coats on hooks. A manager with a pencil mustache and a white shirt that had never seen a second shift.

“Radio’s got a hum,” Vic told him, and tapped the jukebox cabinet like an old friend. He didn’t try the lock. He didn’t have to. Men who mind rooms mind money first; the hum could wait.

We took a table where the counter window caught the light when a man bent the right way. Coffee came black and fast. The manager made the rounds, said three names, pocketed two tips and wrote nothing down. He liked to look like he remembered. The trick works until it doesn’t.

A pair of Red’s boys came in at one twelve like they’d made the time the night before and were proud of keeping it. One had the union pin. The other had a small ledger he kept low. They went straight to the cabinet and didn’t order.

I watched the little glass window. The number was a square wheel click. It sat on 212 when the pin man slid the coin box. He counted in his palm, put most in a bag, kept some visible for the table, and wrote 150 in the book the way a man writes a lie he’s told before.

The manager stood close enough to smell it and didn’t. He was busy remembering a name he hadn’t learned.

“Ear,” Vic said under his breath.

I touched my ear. We don’t say it twice. He watched the room again.

The pin man peeled off bills for the payout with a touch of reluctance, the kind that reads like fairness if you don’t know counters. He made a show of adding a dollar for the soup. The manager laughed like he was in on something and wasn’t.

We finished the coffee and left a nickel on the saucer. Service men leave small and regular. It looks like a habit and not a choice.

Outside, the steam had thinned. Trucks out of the wholesalers took the street mean and honest. We crossed behind them and took a narrow door two buildings down—a bar that changed its name twice a year and never its floor.

The bartender wore sleeves and a watch that didn’t fit his wrist. He cleaned a spot that didn’t need it and looked at the door every time it opened. Not skittish. Counting.

“We got a service call for the radio,” I said. “Owner said it hissed when it got warm.”

He shrugged. “You got a ticket?”

Vic took a blank card from his pocket and showed him the back. Men look at the front when they plan to say no and the back when they plan to let you. He let us.

We didn’t touch the cabinet. I took a stool where the mirror behind the bottles cut the room into angles. Vic stood where he could see the door and not be in it.

A man at the pay phone turned toward the wall to talk to no one and pretended not to see us. He had cheap rubber on his shoes and a shine someone else had put there. He was not a customer.

At one fifty-three the door opened and a collector with shoulders like he’d been carrying his job too long came in alone. No pin. No ledger. Just a key ring and a jaw. He worked fast, wrote nothing, and held his body between the cabinet and the room like we couldn’t see through him.

The bartender drifted close and tried to read the number the way men try to read the future. He failed at both.

The collector paid out on a round number. The window didn’t show a round number when he closed it. I kept my face where it belonged.

“Watch,” Vic said softly.

I coughed. The collector looked up and saw a man with a bad coat and a service bag and decided we were furniture. He left a beer untasted on the bar like a receipt and went out without looking back. The pay phone man waited three breaths and followed.

“Rail,” Vic said a minute later when a third man took the end and put his elbow on the wood like he owned it.

I counted rails. Three men at the rail means a smoke walk. We took our coats outside and lit cigarettes we didn’t want. The cold bit my ribs and I let it. The street read us and went back to work.

“COUNT DAYLIGHT?” Vic asked.

“Not yet,” I said. “They’re not here for us. They’re here for rhythm.”

We walked two more rooms for the price of four coffees. A lunch counter with a Wurlitzer that stuck on ballads. A club with a stage big enough for a band on weekends and too big for the band it had. Same faces different places. The pin showed twice and the jaw once. The ledger stayed low. The numbers didn’t match the money when the room wasn’t looking. They never do when a man thinks he owns a neighborhood.

We didn’t talk about it in the rooms. We talked about it on a loading dock that smelled like oranges and rope. Vic set the bag down and put both hands in his pockets.

“Three days,” he said. “Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. Supper club pays on Saturday to look flush. Lanes on Wednesday to look busy. Gin mill on Friday because the paychecks land.”

“One line each,” I said. “We don’t run all three. We watch the clock. We learn who carries which key.”

He grinned. “Buckets live on Saturday.”

“Buckets get you noticed,” I said. “We need leverage, not applause.”

He looked out at the trucks and the men moving them. “You hear yourself? You sound like a man who found a creed.”

“I found a price,” I said. “We keep the room quiet and let the building do the work.”

He nodded. He didn’t like it. He accepted it.

At the end of the block, a tailor with a radio in his window fiddled with the antenna while a race call chased its own tail. The news came late. People listened like it was live.

We went back into the supper club at two twenty-eight because men who make schedules also make mistakes. The pin was there again. So was the manager with the white shirt and the memory that needed help.

He looked at us and looked away. We were furniture again. That’s where we wanted to be.

The counter window said 224 now. The payout ledger would say something else by supper. I touched my ear. Vic didn’t have to look to know why.

We left a card with a phone number that would ring a store where nobody answered. Service men leave numbers. It reassures a certain kind of manager.

Let him read us, not hear us.

On the walk back toward the river the wind took the steam and the day with it. Vic swung the bag light.

“They’re soft,” he said.

“They’re proud,” I said. “Proud reads soft.”

He laughed once. “Pick your room,” he said. “First hit.”

“North Side lanes,” I said. “Service call. One cabinet, one switch down the line when the building says yes.”

“Saturday?”

“Not Saturday.”

He let that sit.

At the corner a man in a clean hat crossed against the light without looking. The trolley bell hit and stopped. The city kept its pace.

We had what we needed: times, keys, a room that paid attention to the wrong thing. We hadn’t touched a lock. Good.

The Strip breathed behind us. We let it. Then we went to work.

###

# Chapter 6 — Route Cadence Map

We spread butcher paper on Maggie’s back table and kept our elbows off because she asked us to once and we pretended it was a rule.

Vic drew a crooked river and called it a street. He used beer rings for rooms and nickels for men who thought they owned them. I moved the nickels until the picture made noise.

“Wednesday,” he said, and circled the lanes on the North Side. “Service call. You take the hands. I carry the bag.”

“You carry the bag,” I said. “You keep the door in your eye. I don’t want your hands on the brass unless the room asks for a dance.”

He spun a nickel like a trick he’d taught himself to stop thinking. It clattered and laid down.

“Arrive?” he asked.

“One fifteen,” I said. “Window opens at one twenty-eight. You miss it, you get men on lunch, and they notice what’s supposed to be furniture.”

He wrote the numbers like they were gospel and not memory. 1:15. 1:28. He boxed them like the boxes could hold a day still.

“The girl,” he said. “Placards Thursday. She makes it look like we were hired by a man with a clipboard.”

“She posts and leaves,” I said. “She doesn’t wait to be thanked.”

“You don’t like thanks anymore,” he said.

“I count daylight,” I said. “Thanks get you seen.”

He smiled at that like he didn’t want to and drew an X over Saturday at the supper club.

“Buckets live on Saturday,” he said.

“Buckets make noise,” I said. “We’re buying quiet.”

Maggie brought coffee and shoved the ashtray into the corner where we’d parked the city.

“You boys put that paper away if a man in a hat walks in,” she said. “And don’t use my good nickels.”

“Never,” Vic said, palming two he could no longer swear were hers.

I put a short line between the lanes and a gin mill with a floor that remembered shoes. Then a longer line between the gin mill and a supper club with soup and a manager who trusted his memory more than numbers. I drew a third line from the lanes to a back door nobody used in daylight.

“That,” I said, tapping the third line, “is how we leave if they turn the stage lights on.”

Vic nodded. “Tail cut here,” he said, drawing a small circle at the grocer’s alley. “Crates, a truck, a man who minds his own. You cough if we carry the tail through the alley. Ear for nickels. Rail for a smoke walk. Same tells; different air.”

“Same tells,” I said. “No new signals until we need them.”

He wrote the tells along the bottom edge like they were a prayer you could teach a child: Watch=cough. Ear=nickels. Rail>3=smoke walk.

“Keys,” he said, and put a penny over the lanes and a dime over the club. He patted his pocket. It clicked. “Twin for South Side cabinet. Yours for the lanes.”

“My ring and file,” I said. “If the twin lives in the bag, it doesn’t get curious in your hand.”

He let that sit on his pride and didn’t feed it. “Fair.”

We ran the clock without leaving the room. One twelve: pin with the union walks through a door like he kept the hinge in his pocket. One fifteen: we arrive. One twenty-eight: we act. Two ten: jaw with the key ring makes the gin mill honest in the way men call honest when the room is full and the numbers are round.

“Counter beat,” Vic said. “The club paid on a round. Window read odd.”

“One,” I said. “Save the second for when it buys something.”

He marked a single dot over the club and kept the pencil still.

“First hit,” he said. “Say it out loud so I stop asking.”

“Lanes,” I said. “Wednesday. Service call. We touch one cabinet. We switch one box down the line when the building says yes.”

“Who’s the building?”

“The bartender’s watch,” I said. “The phone that rings and doesn’t matter. The man who steps outside for a smoke when the soup gets to a boil. The city tells you when it wants something. You just don’t insult it by asking.”

He laughed once without joy. “You sound like a priest married to a clock.”

“I sound like a man who can’t run stairs until spring,” I said. “We’ll take the ramp.”

Maggie leaned in the doorway and watched the coins like they might give her a race result.

“You going to need a door held?” she said.

“You’ll hold it by letting it close slow,” I said. “And you call a number that rings a store where nobody answers if anyone asks for my boss.”

“I like that number,” she said. “It never argues.”

Vic slid the dime to the edge of the paper and flicked it into his palm. “Rendezvous if we spook?”

“Two blocks east at the tailor with the radio in the window,” I said. “He fights the antenna at two thirty like he’s paid to lose. We buy thread we don’t need. We talk with our backs.”

“And if the tail makes church with us?”

“Market alley,” I said. “Crates, rope, oranges. You put the bag in the truck for a count of five. If nobody climbs in after it, you carry it out the other side. If somebody does, you leave it and we walk. We can buy a new bag.”

He didn’t like leaving the bag. He accepted it.

“Memo?” he said.

“After,” I said. “One memo, one line. Times and the number that didn’t match the smile. We send it to the bean-counter who thinks numbers make men honest.”

Vic looked at the paper until it was wood again.

“Say it back,” I said.

He did, not to please me, but so his mouth would make the shape his hands needed later.

“Wednesday. North Side lanes. One fifteen arrive. One twenty-eight move. Bag with me, hands with you. Watch=cough. Ear=nickels. Rail>3=smoke. Tail cut in the grocer’s alley if they make choir robes out of our shadows. Rendezvous at the tailor if we don’t like the choir.”

“And keys,” I said.

“Twin in the bag until the day it gets used,” he said. “Ring and file on you. I don’t touch unless the room asks for a dance.”

Maggie nodded like she was marking it for a quiz none of us wanted.

I folded the butcher paper once and then again and slid it under the ledger where Maggie keeps the names men tell her and the ones she learns herself.

“You going to sleep?” Vic said.

“I’m going to walk the block until I can see the clock without looking,” I said. “You’re going to go home and stop polishing that twin in your head.”

He picked up the bag and made a face at being told what to do without being told. “Tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow,” I said.

He left the room like he owed it money and was paying in charm. Maggie took the nickels and put them back in the register one by one.

“You boys always think the city talks,” she said.

“It does,” I said. “It just doesn’t care if you hear it.”

We turned the chairs up. We locked the door we’d unlock in daylight. The butcher paper under the ledger made the table look thicker. The room kept its own time. So did we.

When the switch came, we let the room read us.

###

# Chapter 7 — North Side Lanes

Two pins fell on an empty lane. No ball. The manager swore like a prayer you say twice a day and never hear yourself say. Vic carried the bag and let the door close slow behind us.

“Radio men,” he told the boy at the shoe counter.

The boy nodded, grateful to believe anything. He waved us toward the back where the jukebox sat between a trophy case and a picture of a team that used to win.

The room smelled like oil and cheap beer. The oil felt honest.

I checked the cabinet without touching the lock. The hum was real. The belt would be fine. The problem lived in the coin box a room down the line.

“Ticket?” the manager said, appearing from a side door like a coin out of a sleeve.

Vic showed him the back of a blank card. The manager looked at the front, then the door, then us, and decided to remember later. He left us to it.

We set our places. Vic near the door with the bag on a chair. Me in front of the cabinet with my hands where rooms could see them. The lanes took a breath on the minute. The city kept time for us.

At one thirteen a man with a broom swept the same square twice. At one fifteen a phone rang and nobody moved. At one twenty a woman laughed at a joke that wasn’t funny. At one twenty-eight the pin with the union walked in with a ledger under his coat and a smile a size too small.

I coughed once and bent over the cabinet like I meant to be useful. Vic watched the door. The pin didn’t look at us. He set his hat on the table where a man would see it if a man wanted to know who owned the room.

“Hum?” the manager said from nowhere.

“Heat,” I said. “We’ll draw it off.”

I popped the back with my ring and two fingers. No show. No noise. The belt was fine. I looked past it. The counter window read 318. The number told one story. The pin would write another.

“Paper first,” I said, not loud. Vic moved a receipt book to the edge of the counter where the manager could pretend he’d left it there himself.

The pin opened the coin box with a key that had lived in his pocket too long. He counted where everyone could see his hands and nobody could see the bag. He paid out a round number you could split in your head and wrote a different number in the ledger you couldn’t.

“Counter,” Vic murmured.

“One,” I said.

He let the second live for later.

I drew the hum down with a trick you can learn if you listen to electric motors long enough. The cabinet quieted. The room read us as men who fixed things.

At one thirty-four the jaw arrived—broad shoulders, no pin, a jaw that did the talking. He didn’t like that we were furniture. He liked that we were useful. He stayed close enough to be a wall.

“Five minutes,” I said to the manager. “We’ll swap a filter and let it cool.”

The manager nodded like he understood the words. He didn’t. He liked that they sounded like words a man uses when he means to do right.

Vic set the bag near my hand and looked past me at the lanes. Two pins fell on an empty lane again. No ball. The boy at shoes crossed himself.

“Bad wire,” I said. “It’ll pass.”

“Let it,” the manager said.

The pin closed the ledger and made a point of putting it away slow. The jaw watched his hands. Good. Hands are loud if you’re listening.

I slid the old coin box free and set it near the edge. The cabinet across the aisle had the twin. The line between them was short and quiet. Rooms like that. They like fixes that don’t brag.

“Watch,” Vic said.

I coughed. The jaw turned to see who needed a drink. The pin looked at his hat like it might jump. The manager took two steps toward a phone that had stopped ringing.

I switched the boxes.

It took less than a breath. A breath is a long time when your ribs talk in winter. Mine did. I held it like I was saving money.

The hum settled into a lower note. The window read 0 because I’d let it. The manager smiled. He thought that meant new.

“Fresh as Sunday,” he said.

“Don’t run it hot for ten,” I said. “Let it find its own speed.”

He nodded and went to tell someone he’d fixed something.

The pin took his hat and the jaw left the wall. They didn’t hurry. Men who think they own a neighborhood don’t learn hurry until it costs them.

We packed the bag slow. Vic did the zipper like a man who didn’t want to wake a baby. The boy at shoes watched our hands like he wanted to be us when he got older and smarter.

At the door, the manager remembered the card. “If it acts up,” he said.

“It won’t,” I said. “If it does, call and keep the cabinet closed until we get here.”

He liked being told a rule. It makes a man feel like he’s part of the work.

Outside, the street took our breath and kept it. We gave it willingly. Paper first. Breath second.

“Buckets?” Vic said as we walked toward the tailor who fought his antenna at two thirty.

“Not today,” I said.

“You’re going to starve on nickels.”

“I like living on them,” I said.

He carried the bag and didn’t argue out loud.

We stood in front of the tailor’s window and watched a race call chase itself around the dial. The man inside adjusted the antenna with a patience I envied. The result came late. The city pretended it was live. The city liked pretending.

“Jaw saw your hands,” Vic said.

“He saw what I wanted him to,” I said. “He saw a man fix a hum and a manager nod. He saw paper on the counter and a number in a window that tells one story. He’ll tell himself the rest.”

“You make the truth loud,” Vic said. It wasn’t a question.

###

# Chapter 8 — Variance Call

The phone rang once and stopped. Maggie wiped the glass where the stamp sat. The tape made a small sound and changed its mind.

“Hungry?” she said.

“I could be,” I said.

She poured coffee anyway. It was late enough to taste like the bottom of the pot and early enough to need it.

It rang again. She picked up with the register drawer open like it could protect her voice.

“Palmer,” she said.

A man’s voice. Flat, office air. “Confirming a service call Wednesday. North Side lanes at one fifteen, remedy for equipment hum. For our sheets.”

Maggie looked at me. I nodded.

“That sounds right,” she said. “Do you need a copy of the receipt?”

A pause. Paper moved in another room. “If it’s no trouble.”

“It won’t be,” she said, and set the receiver down slow.

“Accounts,” I said.

She didn’t ask how I knew. She didn’t have to.

The door opened and Sergeant Dugan brought the outside in with him. He took a stool like it had his name on it.

“Coffee,” he said.

Maggie poured and didn’t meet his eye. He noticed. Men like him always do.

“You kids are very organized,” he said. “Stamps, receipts, phone calls. A man could get the wrong idea.”

“The right one’s cheaper,” I said.

He smiled without teeth. “You sent something up the line.”

“We sent coffee,” I said. “And a receipt in case a man forgets.”

“Funny,” he said. He sipped and set the cup down in a ring his hand had made a dozen times in other rooms. “Red’s boys don’t like paperwork. Paperwork gets read.”

“That’s the point,” I said.

He looked at the stamp. “You put that any higher and a judge could see it from his bench.”

“Good eyesight is a public service.”

He chuckled and shook his head once. “You’re going to make work for me.”

“I thought you liked work,” I said.

“I like easy work,” he said. “When everyone understands the arrangement.”

“We like arrangements too,” I said. “That’s why we write them down.”

He took his time finishing the coffee. He left a bill under the saucer and stood like a man who had something else to say and decided to keep it.

At one twelve, we walked to a bar that changed its name twice a year and never its floor. The hum lived here yesterday. Today it had manners.

The bartender watched the door like it owed him money. He nodded at us. We were furniture again. It suited me.

At one twenty-six the pin with the union came in with the jaw behind him. No ledger. The jaw had it, or nobody did. They paid closer to the window this time. That was the first beat.

I watched the little glass. It read 244 when they opened the box. The payout to the bartender’s hand wasn’t round. It landed near 240 and died there. The jaw looked at the number longer than he looked at the money.

“Counter,” Vic would have said. He wasn’t with me. I said it in my head and let it be one.

They made a show of writing in the book where the bartender could see the top of the page and not the numbers. The top said ROUTE in block letters. It might as well have said TRUST ME.

The bartender nodded like he knew how to read. He didn’t. He knew how to be seen reading. He was good at that.

“Service men,” the jaw said to me without turning his head.

“Radio,” I said.

“Hum?”

“Heat,” I said. “It passed.”

He grunted. Not friendly, not hostile. Accounting.

Outside, the traffic set its pulse. Trucks took the hill like they owned it. The city kept time whether we wanted it to or not.

At the lunch counter on Penn the manager with the white shirt decided to be generous. He was generous in the way a man is when he thinks someone else is paying. He made change with a flourish. The pin watched his hands and said nothing.

The counter window said 228. The payout said 220. The ledger said something a little larger when the pin put the book away. That was the second beat.

We left the card with the dead number on our way out. The manager liked having a number. Numbers feel like a safety net if you don’t look down.

Back at Maggie’s, the light on the stamp had turned cold. The tape lifted and laid back down again. It was a small thing. Small things tell you where the draft is.

“Falco?” Maggie said.

“Maybe,” I said. “Maybe someone under him with a pencil and a pride problem.”

“What’s that buy us?”

“Time,” I said. “Men argue about numbers before they break things. Most days.”

She thought about that and didn’t like it. “Most days.”

“It’s the best I can do without hiring a priest,” I said.

She smiled. It didn’t reach her eyes.

The door opened on a gust of cold and closed without delivering a customer. A mark on the alley door had been touched up. Same blue, sharper X. Someone believed in the symbol enough to redraw it.

“We posted,” she said, looking at the stamp like it could learn to fight.

“We did,” I said. “And we’ll keep posting.”

She nodded. “I’ll get the receipts in order.”

“Make them neat,” I said. “Neat makes men lazy.”

She went to the back for a folder and the radio in the kitchen coughed into a race call that arrived a breath too late. The city pretended not to notice. That’s what cities do when they want to keep breathing.

I felt the cost in my ribs when I stood. You don’t lift a breath in winter without paying. I paid.

Dugan stepped in again near close. He didn’t take a stool.

“You got a friend in Accounts now,” he said.

“I have a receipt,” I said.

He looked at the stamp and then at the door to the alley. “You keep it neat,” he said. “I can keep you out of a squad car for a while. You make me look like a fool, I put you in it myself.”

“That’s fair,” I said.

He left. He didn’t touch the rail on the way out.

Maggie set a stack of papers under the register. Serial sheets on top. Receipts under them. The napkin with our terms at the bottom like a foundation.

“You hungry now?” she said.

“I could be,” I said.

She made a sandwich I didn’t deserve and handed it over like a benediction.

We locked up. The stamp held the last light again and let it go.

Most cons want applause. Ours wanted silence.

###

# Chapter 9 — Mark and Lock

They moved at dawn when the street forgot its name. The alley door had a new idea about security. A bright lock plate, wrong metal, wrong hands. The screws were proud of themselves.

Maggie touched the plate with one finger. “That ours?”

“No,” I said. “Ours have sense.”

She looked at the blue X. It had a fresh coat. Smaller now, meaner. Theater learns from itself.

“Paper first,” I said. “Breath second.”

She nodded and unlocked the front, not the alley. We let the glass do the talking.

At ten a man in a gray coat came in with a clipboard that didn’t belong to him. He had city on the voice and Red in the shoes. He set the board on the bar and didn’t sit.

“Inspection,” he said. “Unscheduled. Complaint about an unlicensed device.”

“Our device is coffee,” I said. “Licensed by the pound.”

He didn’t smile. “Back door. Hardware. Also coin-operated entertainment.” He looked past me at the jukebox like he wanted it to answer for its life.

“Show me the paper,” I said.

He lifted a form that had numbers in the right places and signatures in hands I’d seen on better days. It would pass a glance. It wouldn’t pass a man with a memory.

“Wait here,” I said.

I took it to the window where the stamp lived. The light made the ink honest. The date was clean. The seal was tired. The city works, then it rests.

“You going to cooperate?” he said. His jaw worked gum that wasn’t there.

“We always do,” I said. “On paper.”

He didn’t like that. Men sent for muscle never do. He looked at the alley door like it had hurt his feelings. “We’ll need access.”

“You’ll get it,” I said, and set the form on a towel like evidence.

Vic came in with the morning cold on his coat and a hungrier look than usual. He saw the board, saw the man, and started counting rooms in his head.

“Bucket day,” he said to me under his breath.

“Not today,” I said.

“Why not?”

“Because they want us to push. We don’t.”

He hated that kind of answer. He loved action you could stack in a bag.

The gray coat walked to the jukebox and put a hand on the glass like a priest. “We’ll secure this pending review.”

“That isn’t how it works,” I said. “You note it. You schedule. You come back with a man who knows music from a meter.”

He turned. “You saying no?”

“I’m saying read your form,” I said. “Box twelve.”

He looked down. Box Twelve said SCHEDULED FOLLOW-UP with a blank line and a place for a date. He didn’t have a date. He had a line and a pair of friends outside.

The door opened on cue. Two men without coats felt like winter anyway. One with a key ring like a wind chime. The other had the kind of shoulders that carry people.

“Morning,” the ring said.

“Evening,” I said. It was the wrong time. He noticed.

Dugan came five beats after like he’d been told not to and did it anyway. He took a place between the jukebox and the alley door and looked bored. He was working.

“Problem?” he said.

“Inspection,” I said, and held the form so he could see it and not touch it.

The ring had opinions. “We have authority to secure.”

“Do you,” Dugan said. He read faster than he looked. “Funny, this here says follow-up. You boys are very eager.”

The gray coat tried to recover dignity he hadn’t earned. “Complaint mentions tampering.”

“Then you’ll be thrilled with a neat counter,” I said. “Two forty-two last night. Payout two thirty-four. Eight short. Manager signed. You can check Penn. They like to check Penn.”

That was the first beat and I let it sit. Numbers make men argue before they swing. Most days.

Vic bristled beside me. He wanted me to shut up and run a route that didn’t exist. He wanted cash that spends.

Dugan scratched his neck with one finger. “Here’s how it is,” he said, voice for the room, not the men. “You keep this neat. Real neat. No shout, no push, no reason to visit. You get to keep the glass. You hand me an envelope, I hand it back. You hand them a scene, I hand you a squad car. We clear?”

“We’re clear,” I said.

The ring smiled like a hinge. “We’ll be back with a padlock.”

“You won’t,” Dugan said. “Not today.”

They left the cold behind. The gray coat took his form and forgot to ask for a copy. He’d remember later and blame someone else.

Vic let the air out slow. “You keep dodging,” he said. “At some point the fist finds you.”

“It always does,” I said. “We choose where.”

He shook his head. “Buckets would buy us a better choice.”

“Buckets buy noise,” I said. “Noise brings more fists.”

He looked at the bright plate on the alley door. “They’ll come back with steel.”

“They might,” I said. “We’ll have paper.”

He laughed once without humor. “Paper burns.”

“Sometimes it doesn’t,” I said. That was the aphorism and I let it be one.

We opened slow. Regulars came in with their quiet. The radio lagged a breath behind the city and tried to catch up. The metronome didn’t care.

At one fifteen the Ford took the corner like it owned the block. The gray coat rode shotgun. The ring and the shoulders in back. They parked crooked and legal.

Maggie went to the register without being told. She put the receipt book on the rail where men can read. She posted the last stamp above it just because.

“Let them read us,” she said.

The door swung and stalled on the bright plate like it was thinking.

“Follow-up,” the gray coat said. He had a new form. It looked better than the first. Someone had fixed the seal.

“Congratulations,” I said. “You learned to schedule.”

He held it out. “Sign for receipt of notice.”

I read it. Real numbers. Real office. The date was today and the hour now. They had dressed muscle in a suit and taught it to spell.

“Fine,” I said, and signed where men sign when they can’t help it.

“We’ll secure pending review,” he said, happy to be back on the line he memorized.

“Not without inventory,” I said. “You list the coins in the box. You list the records in the slot. You count in front of us, and you seal it with our signatures. Or you leave it where it is and pencil your threat.”

He looked at Dugan. Dugan didn’t blink. “Neat,” he said. “Or ride.”

The ring had the lock ready. He set it on the bar so we could see the teeth. He liked the sound it made when he put it down.

“Inventory,” I said again.

“Count it yourself,” the ring said.

“That’s not how it works,” I said. “You want custody, you take the weight.”

That was the second beat. Counters make men tired when they expected easy.

Maggie brought out a pad and a pencil that had been sharpened to a mean point. “Start with what you can see,” she said. “We’ll do the back last.”

They argued about the order. Red’s boys didn’t like being clerks. They put the lock back in the pocket and took out a sheet instead. Paper changed their minds for them.

An hour later the jukebox was still ours and the door had a new nail where a padlock would have gone. The notice sat under the stamp. The blue X on the alley door didn’t look so sure of itself.

Vic stood with his hands open like he’d lost something. “You win today,” he said. “Tomorrow they bring more men.”

“Tomorrow we’re open,” I said. “And posted.”

At close a different man brought a different envelope and slid it toward me with two fingers. “For coffee,” he said.

“Keep it,” I said.

He didn’t like that either.

We locked up. The new plate looked back at me. It would want a padlock like a hungry mouth wants a spoon.

The notice under the stamp had a time in red pencil. Ten a.m. tomorrow. Real inspection. Real authority. The turn came dressed as paperwork. Muscle in a suit.

I put the towel over the form like a blanket. The city kept time. We tried to sleep on it.

###

# Chapter 10 — Paper Teeth

At nine forty-five I set the towel aside and read the notice again. Same red pencil time. The corners showed thumbprints. Men always leave prints when they hurry.

Maggie wiped the glass where the stamp sat. “You want coffee for them?”

“For the paper,” I said. “It does most of the talking.”

She brewed anyway. She liked to feed enemies. It made friends nervous.

They came at ten sharp with a second car behind them, this one city, not Ford. The gray coat had upgraded to a tie. The ring had a new lock in his pocket and a grin that thought ahead. Shoulders carried a flat wooden box with twine.

A woman in a navy suit stepped in last. Clipboard, real authority, not the borrowed kind. She took in the room the way a tailor takes in a man. “Inspection,” she said, and didn’t have to prove it.

“Welcome,” I said. “We laid out what you’ll need.” I put the receipt book, the serial sheet, and a fresh pad on the bar, clean. Maggie set down pens like little spears.

The woman glanced at the notice under the stamp and at the stamp itself. “You posted.”

“We like to be seen,” I said.

“Good,” she said. “My name is Ms. Hart.” She nodded at gray coat. “He’s with me today. He wasn’t yesterday.”

Gray coat swallowed something he didn’t want to eat.

Dugan stood outside under the awning and smoked. He watched the sidewalk like it might confess. He didn’t come in. It meant he didn’t have to. Neat kept him where he wanted to be.

“Order of operations,” Ms. Hart said. “Back door hardware first. Then the device. If we secure, we inventory together.”

“That’s the order,” I said.

We went to the back. She looked at the bright lock plate and the proud screws. “Who installed this?”

“Not us,” Maggie said.

“Do you have a work order?” Ms. Hart said to gray coat.

He didn’t. The ring jingled his keys to make sound where there wasn’t an answer.

Ms. Hart tilted the plate once with a thumbnail. The screws didn’t like it. “Remove it,” she said. “Wrong hardware. Wrong hands.”

The ring started to argue and found no words that could stand up. He took the plate off and held it like it might bite him. It didn’t.

“Door passes,” Ms. Hart said. “Front stamp is in order.” She tapped the glass. “Now the device.”

At the jukebox she opened the top with a small tool from her bag. No flourish. She knew machines. The smell of dust and coins walked out.

“Count,” she said, and handed gray coat the pad.

“I’ll do it,” Maggie said.

“You witness,” Ms. Hart said. “I’ll do it.” She started clearing the coin tray into the flat box Shoulders carried. Coins hit wood with a steady sound. She called numbers. “Two twelve. Two nineteen. Two thirty-one.”

I wrote them in the chain ledger and kept my handwriting straight. The ring leaned to see and didn’t like seeing.

“Payout?” Ms. Hart said.

“Two thirty-four,” I said. “Last night. Manager signature. Counter window said two forty-two.”

“That spread is directionally consistent with normal drift,” gray coat said, using words that didn’t belong to him.

“Not with the stamp that high,” I said.

She didn’t smile. “Noted.” She pulled a record and checked the selector like she was making sure it still wanted to sing. “Who services selections?”

“We do,” I said. “When they’re tired.”

“You have invoices?”

“Receipts,” I said, and slid the book open to a page that had lines and dates. She looked until she was done, not until she saw what she wanted.

Dugan flicked ash outside. He watched the metronome go. Buses took the corner on time. The city stayed on beat.

“We can secure,” gray coat tried again. The ring touched the new lock in his pocket like a pet.

Ms. Hart shut the lid. “Not today. No immediate hazard. Device is posted and inventoried. Recommended action: permit review and service schedule. I’ll note the counterfeit notice from yesterday.” She looked at me. “You kept the towel over it. Why?”

“To keep the tape from lifting ink,” I said.

“Neat,” she said, and wrote it.

Vic drifted closer. “We done?”

“Almost,” I said.

Ms. Hart wrote for a long minute. Gray coat watched his future shrink. Shoulders looked at the floor he understood.

“Two options,” Ms. Hart said. “One, you operate as-is under observation with weekly counters turned over to our office. Two, you apply for a cabaret adjunct permit that formalizes the device and sets a fixed skim.”

Gray coat brightened. “Fixed skim,” he said, because he heard his boss’s name in it.

Ms. Hart kept writing. “The fixed skim goes to the city.”

The light in his eyes went out.

“What does the permit cost?” Maggie said.

“Money,” Ms. Hart said. “And consistency. You’ll be seen more. You’ll be protected more.”

Maggie looked at me. I nodded once. Protection you can read beats protection you can’t, until it doesn’t. The aphorism tried to climb out. I kept it in.

“We’ll take the observation for now,” I said. “We like paper that breathes.”

“Then sign,” Ms. Hart said. “Chain of custody for today’s count stays with me. Copy for you.”

I signed. Maggie signed. Ms. Hart signed. The room felt lighter just because the pen moved.

She tore the counterfeit notice in half and handed the pieces to gray coat. “If you come back with one of these, bring better.”

He put the halves in his pocket like he might tape them later and learned nothing.

At the door Ms. Hart paused at the stamp. “Keep it posted.”

“We like to be seen,” Maggie said again. It sounded like faith when she said it.

They left without the lock. Dugan ground his cigarette out in the snow and tipped two fingers through the glass. He didn’t come in. He didn’t have to.

Vic came up on my shoulder. “So that’s it,” he said. “No buckets. No padlock. Just paper.”

“Paper with teeth,” I said.

He looked at my ribs when I reached for the towel. “Until it bites us.”

“Everything does,” I said. “Pick your bite.”

We put the towel back over the new form—observation order, chain ledger copy stapled to it. The radio called a race a breath behind. The city didn’t slow down for any of us.

By late afternoon two regulars asked about the inspection like it was weather. Maggie showed them the posting. They nodded. A man at the far stool left a tip larger than the coffee demanded. Sometimes neat pays.

Near close a boy from City ran in with an envelope and no breath. He saluted the stamp like it was a flag. “From Ms. Hart,” he said.

Inside: a permit packet, clipped. A note in tight hand: If you want the adjunct, bring these Wednesday, two o’clock. No intermediaries.

Maggie swallowed. “That’s fast.”

“They want to own the song,” I said.

“Do we?”

“We want to pick it,” I said. “Owning comes later.”

She put the packet under the register, on top of the napkin with our terms. It rode there like it belonged.

Outside, the blue X on the alley door looked small against clean wood. The screws had holes to remember where they tried to live.

We locked up. The stamp held the last light and let it go. The notice under it wasn’t red now. It was black ink and carbon. The turn wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be.

###

# Chapter 11 — Permit Window

At one ten Vic buttoned his coat like it was armor. He checked the bag and the service cards and looked at me like I’d picked the wrong day to love paper.

“You sure about City?” he said.

“They said no intermediaries,” I said. “I believe them when they write.”

He grunted. “They write with your blood when you aren’t looking.”

“Keep it neat,” I said. “No scenes. If they push, you count.”

He left at one twelve. I watched the mirror clock until the hands touched thirteen and a half. The city kept time without help. It always did.

Maggie tied the envelope with twine like she was packing a lunch for a child who bites. “We take this and we come back,” she said.

“We do,” I said. “If something breaks, Dugan has the number.”

City-County smelled like paper and cold stone. The woman at the desk handed me a numbered ticket and kept her eyes on her own stack.

“Window Three for adjunct,” she said. “Two o’clock.”

The clock on the far wall said one fifty-eight. It would not be hurried. Men are.

Ms. Hart came out from a side door at two and nodded once without smiling. She didn’t wave us forward. The number did that for her.

“Forms,” she said.

I slid the packet, the receipts, the serial sheet copy. She flipped without ceremony, then slowed on the napkin with our terms.

“You bring everything,” she said.

“We count,” I said.

A man in a good suit and bad instincts put a card on the ledge and smiled like he was about to make friends. “Compliance liaison,” he said. The card said CONSULTANT.

“Intermediary,” I said.

Ms. Hart didn’t look up. “Not required.”

The man’s smile didn’t know where to go. “It speeds things along.”

“Nothing speeds the City along,” I said. “It moves when it’s ready.”

He left the card anyway and drifted down the line like a salesman in a store that doesn’t need what he sells.

“Fee,” Ms. Hart said.

Maggie counted bills slow and even. “Receipt,” she said, just as even.

The clerk at Three ran the till. The number on the receipt came out wrong. Not the amount. The sequence.

“This jumps,” I said.

The clerk blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Your last was 11837,” I said, pointing to the stack in his drawer. “This is 11835. Paper remembers when men don’t.”

That was the aphorism. I kept my mouth shut after it.

Ms. Hart looked, compared, and didn’t like what she saw. She reached for another book from the shelf. “Use this,” she said to the clerk. “Staple both.”

He did. The top copy got an ink stamp that sounded like a door latching. I wrote the time down anyway. Two oh-six, City’s clock.

On Penn at one twenty-six the pin and the jaw arrived together to make it look official. Vic told me later the manager had sweat on his lip and flair in his hands.

“Collections,” the jaw said.

“Service,” Vic said. He put the dead-number card on the rail where hands could see and minds could pretend to understand. “Radio hum.”

The pin kept the book close. Too close. He opened the box. The counter window said 207. The payout to the till said 198 and went fast.

“Counter,” Vic said, quiet. He let the word sit.

The jaw decided to be muscle with an audience. He made a move like lids slam themselves. Vic moved his hand slower than the lid and still lost a little meat.

He told me it stung, like winter air does. He told me he didn’t give them a scene. He kept the card on the rail and watched the pin pretend to write route across the top of a page that would never be read.

Back at Three, Ms. Hart took our signatures and gave us hers. “Observation continues,” she said. “Adjunct goes to review. Friday morning, nine.”

“Friday is route,” Maggie said.

“I don’t set the day,” Ms. Hart said. “I show up on it.”

The consultant glided back with his smile intact. “Friday’s tricky,” he said. “I can smooth it.”

“No,” I said.

He touched the card. “You’ll have my number.”

“I won’t,” I said, and slid it back to him without touching it.

Ms. Hart stamped the top page. The sound felt like a promise that wasn’t personal. Those are the only ones that hold.

Outside, Dugan leaned on a pillar and watched the pigeons calculate angles.

“You went in,” he said.

“They asked,” I said. “We listened.”

He nodded at the envelope in my hand. “Red’s pushing Penn.”

“I figured,” I said.

“Your man okay?”

“He’ll count with nine fingers for a day,” I said. “He kept it neat.”

Dugan’s mouth moved like it might become a smile and chose not to. “Friday at nine,” he said. “That’s a nice hour for problems.”

“We’ll bring coffee,” I said.

At the bar, the stamp held the late light again. The observation order had a new friend under it—the application copy, staple proud.

Vic poured his own coffee and didn’t put sugar in. He held his hand flat on the counter like he was testing a table he’d built.

“They wanted the lid,” he said.

“They always do,” I said.

He looked at the receipt we brought back. “Friday?”

“Nine,” I said. “We’ll have to split on a split.”

He shook his head. “They’re getting smarter.”

“So do we,” I said.

Maggie slid the compliance card onto the bar with two fingers and let it sit in the open. The name on it didn’t matter. The idea did.

“They’ll send him back,” she said.

“Then he can watch,” I said. “We’ll post for him too.”

The radio caught a race a breath late and bragged about it anyway. Trucks took the hill in even rows. The city kept time and didn’t care who danced.

At close, a boy from City brought a second slip. REVIEW SCHEDULED, it said in black with a line under it: Friday, nine. Someone had underlined the nine twice in pencil. Not Hart’s hand.

We locked up. The holes from the wrong screws on the back door waited like small mouths. The blue X looked tired.

We had paper that moved. Friday would test if it could run.

###

# Chapter 12 — Two Corners

At eight fifty-five the corridor outside Window Three smelled like floor wax and fear. The review slip curled at one corner like it wanted to leave. It didn’t.

Maggie stood with the envelope under her arm and a jaw set for winter. She didn’t talk. She watched the clock.

Ms. Hart opened the side door at nine and waved us in. No ceremony. The consultant was already in the room. His card sat on the table like a stray chip.

“Who invited him?” I said.

“Nobody,” Ms. Hart said. “He invites himself.”

He smiled. “I coordinate,” he said.

“You confuse,” I said.

Ms. Hart put the chain ledger on the table and laid yesterday’s corrected receipt on top. “Sequence issue resolved,” she said. “Ledger consistent.”

He slid a new receipt forward like a magician with a second deck. The number looked right. The ink looked too fresh.

“Staple that,” I said.

“We will,” Ms. Hart said, and reached for the stapler. The staple hit with a sound that calmed me more than it should have.

On Penn at nine twelve the pin came in without the jaw, which meant the jaw was already in the back room. Vic read it. He put the dead-number card on the rail and kept his hands where men could see them and misjudge him.

“Collections,” the pin said.

“Service,” Vic said. The box read 189. The payout hit 176 and paused like it might change its mind and didn’t.

“Counter,” Vic said, quiet.

The jaw came out of the back and made the aisle small. “You got a lot to say for service,” he said.

“I write better than I talk,” Vic said, and lifted the card.

At City, Ms. Hart asked simple questions and looked at the answers like they might lie. “Observation compliant,” she said. “Adjunct review—recommend approval with condition: second inspection next week.”

“What condition?” I said.

“Selections need labeling,” she said. “No handwritten titles.”

“We can print,” I said.

The consultant leaned in. “Permit comes with ongoing fees. I can advise schedule.”

“You can leave,” Ms. Hart said without heat. He didn’t.

Dugan’s shadow cut across the glass outside and then withdrew. He was there and then not. He liked to move on the beat.

At the lanes on North Side the manager tried to be generous with someone else’s money again. Vic watched the payout land round and light. The counter said 244. The till said 236. The ledger stayed hidden.

“Counter,” he said. That was the second beat and he let it ring.

The jaw decided to make an example. He pushed the lid hard. Vic’s hand met it halfway and lost. Something gave. He kept his face quiet and his other hand on the service card like it was a cross.

The boy at the shoe bench looked up and then down fast. Men learn what to see.

At City the consultant produced a memo with a header that wanted to be official when it grew up. “Compliance review suggests postponement pending neighborhood input,” he said.

“From who?” I said.

He gestured with an empty hand. “Stakeholders.”

Ms. Hart didn’t sigh. “No postponement,” she said. “Adjunct recommended. Final sign-off Monday, after labeling.”

The consultant reached for the paper and met Dugan’s hand instead. I hadn’t seen him come in. He put one finger on the memo and looked at the man until the memo forgot what it was.

“You boys keep finding paper in alleys,” Dugan said. “City’s got its own.”

The consultant took his hand back like it had been burned by cold.

On Penn, the jaw smiled the way a man does before a bad decision. He reached for Vic’s collar. Vic stepped back and let a chair take the grab. It clattered. Everyone heard it. The room held its breath.

Dugan showed up in that silence like he’d been hiding behind it. He didn’t raise his voice. “Neat,” he said. “Or ride.”

The jaw let go. He didn’t like it. He liked the alternative less.

“Write your number,” Vic said to the pin. “I’ll write mine next to it.” He kept his broken hand still and his voice from shaking.

At City, Ms. Hart stamped the recommendation with a seal that didn’t care about anyone in the room. “Next week for the second inspection,” she said. “Label your selections. Keep the observation clean.”

Maggie nodded once. “We post,” she said.

We stepped out into the corridor. The clock said nine forty-seven. The city moved on. It always does.

Vic walked back into Maggie’s at one with his hand wrapped in a bar rag. He didn’t make a face until he sat down.

“They put a lock on the back of DeMarco’s,” he said. “Not ours. Same plate as the one we pulled.”

“They’re moving doors,” I said.

He poured coffee with his good hand and watched it steam. “They’ll come back for ours.”

“They might,” I said. “We’ll be posted. We’ll be labeled.”

Maggie laid a sheet of paper on the bar. It had neat typed titles for every record in the box. “I started,” she said.

She had. It looked like she’d been preparing to be legal her whole life.

“Red’s not going to love Monday,” Vic said.

“Red can read,” I said. “If he can’t, someone will read it to him.”

The pain found me when I picked up the sheet. Ribs remind you when you get confident. I put the paper down and let the breath pass.

At close we checked the back. The holes from the wrong screws looked older. The blue X was a ghost of itself. Across the alley DeMarco’s had a new plate and a brand-new padlock. It shone like a coin you don’t spend.

We didn’t touch it. We looked, and then we went in. The city kept time for both of us.

Turn
- Adjunct recommended with labeling condition; second inspection set for next week (final sign-off Monday).
- Penn goes hot; Vic’s hand injured under a lid but keeps it neat; Dugan enforces once.
- New lock appears at DeMarco’s back door—Red moves muscle next door instead of here for now.

###

# Chapter 13 — Final Stamp

We printed the titles the way you lay out a will—clean, no flourishes, no chance for argument. Maggie set the strips on the bar under a dictionary that had belonged to somebody’s father. The paper took the weight and behaved.

“Spelling?” she said.

“Right enough,” I said.

She lifted the book. The labels lay flat and ready. I peeled one, then another, and we worked the slots until the machine read like a ledger.

Dugan came at nine and didn’t come in. He looked through the glass at the labels the way a man looks at clean shoes. He tapped two fingers on the window frame and went back to watching nothing happen.

“You still won’t take coffee?” Maggie called.

“I’ll take neat,” he said, and drifted to the corner where the light didn’t reach. He liked it there.

At nine thirty I opened the chain ledger and matched it against the copy Ms. Hart had left. Numbers where numbers go. Signatures where signatures live. Men make trouble. Paper makes order.

That was the aphorism. I let it be one and shut up.

“Penn?” Maggie said.

“Two-oh-seven on the glass,” I said. “They paid one ninety-eight again and liked pretending it was generosity.”

She wrote it down without comment. She didn’t write the part where the jaw nearly took Vic’s hand off. We keep the cost in the bones and the numbers on the page.

Ms. Hart arrived at ten with the same bag and a different expression. She looked less like a cop and more like a teacher who wanted you to pass.

“Labels,” she said.

Maggie opened the box smooth. Every slot had a typed name that held its shape.

Ms. Hart nodded. “Selections are legible. No obscenity. No handwritten substitutions.”

“No obscene songs,” Maggie said. “We don’t get that kind of crowd.”

“You’d be surprised what passes for obscene,” Ms. Hart said, and marked a line on her sheet. “Chain ledger?”

I handed it over. She put our copy beside hers and went line by line like a tailor checks a seam. “Consistent,” she said. “Observation clean.”

The consultant came in on a draft that didn’t belong to the door. He had a new card with the same old name.

“Morning,” he said. “I can walk the fee schedule—”

“No,” Maggie said.

He kept the smile. “City likes a friendly intermediary.”

“City likes procedure,” Ms. Hart said, not looking up. “Procedure is friendly.”

He tried the counter then. “Post once a week instead of daily. Less clutter on the glass.”

“Post daily,” Ms. Hart said. “It keeps men honest.”

He looked at me for help. I watched the clock. The city took a breath and gave it back.

“Adjunct is approved,” Ms. Hart said. She stamped the top copy with a seal that didn’t ask permission. The sound had weight. She signed with a steady hand. “Post this high, center.”

Maggie took the certificate like a woman receiving a child. She went to the window and set it where the stamp lived. The glass held both without complaint.

“Any changes to selections require notice,” Ms. Hart said. “Counters turned over Mondays at four. Observation continues for one month.”

“Understood,” I said.

Dugan opened the door long enough to smell the ink and the dust and approve them with a look. “Congratulations,” he said to the room. “You made a jukebox respectable. What’s next, getting married?”

“Not to you,” Maggie said.

He let the door fall back to almost closed and left it there. He listened to the hallway like it had secrets.

The consultant tried one last angle. “Adjuncts can share in a neighborhood fund, discretionary—”

“Out,” Ms. Hart said. It wasn’t loud. It didn’t have to be.

He took the hint and the air changed after him.

Ms. Hart put a second sheet on the bar. “Accounts asked for this,” she said. “It’s a reconciliation notice. Outbound.”

“Outbound where?” I said.

She tapped the header. “Malloy’s office.”

Maggie looked at me and then at the certificate on the glass. “That going to hurt us?”

“It’s not about us,” Ms. Hart said. “It’s about a spread that doesn’t match across rooms.”

We had our first counter beat in the open, and it wasn’t ours to argue. I kept my face still.

She finished her notes. “Post. Keep it neat. If a man in a gray coat comes in with fresh paper, call me.”

“We will,” I said.

She left with less sound than she brought in. Dugan’s shadow peeled off the wall and followed her down the block far enough to make a point and not far enough to be a date.

We posted the certificate above the stamp and stepped back. The window read like a sermon.

Vic came in with his hand wrapped in a clean towel. He tried to smile and didn’t make it all the way.

“Sunday night they put the lock on DeMarco’s right after close,” he said. “This morning they posted a notice that the lock is voluntary pending review.”

“Voluntary,” I said.

“Men like that volunteer other people’s doors,” he said.

“We leave it,” I said. “They can learn on their own wood for once.”

He looked like he wanted to argue. He didn’t. He watched the certificate take the light and nodded at the labels like they’d been waiting for his approval.

At noon the phone rang twice and stopped. Accounts has a rhythm when it calls. It called again and stayed on the line.

“Palmer,” Maggie said.

A man with office air. “Confirming weekly counter turnover at four beginning today,” he said. “And noting outbound reconciliation memo to Malloy Office. For our sheets.”

“For your sheets,” Maggie said. She hung up and looked at the ledger like it might bite.

“Paper’s moving,” she said.

“Good,” I said. “Let it run.”

The city kept its beat outside. Trucks climbed the hill in time. The radio came in a breath late and didn’t apologize. The metronome doesn’t.

At three fifty we put the totals in an envelope and wrote the time on the flap. Maggie licked it shut like an oath. I walked it to City with my ribs complaining just enough to be heard.

Ms. Hart took the envelope herself at the desk. “On time,” she said.

“We try,” I said.

She slid a copy of the reconciliation memo across the counter like a bartender with a check. “You didn’t see this here,” she said. “But if you hear laments in the neighborhood, now you know what music’s playing.”

The memo said what we already understood. Accounts wanted to know why numbers bent when the stamp stood straight. It had three rooms listed and a space after Malloy’s name where a signature should live. It didn’t.

I didn’t smile. “Understood.”

Back at the bar the late light got lazy on the glass and the certificate held it like a catcher’s mitt. Maggie wiped a nonexistent smudge from the corner and left it cleaner anyway.

“DeMarco?” she said.

“We let it be,” I said. “For now.”

“Red won’t like the memo.”

“Red doesn’t like arithmetic,” I said. “It likes him less.”

We locked up early enough to see the street before it turned into something else. Across the alley the new padlock at DeMarco’s caught the last light and threw it back ugly. Our door showed holes where the wrong screws had been and no fresh metal. I liked our door better.

Inside, the machine looked new just because it told the truth. Not loud. Just honest. The certificate said so in black ink and carbon.

Turn
- Adjunct permit approved and posted; labels complete; observation continues with weekly Monday counters.
- Accounts reconciliation memo to Malloy’s office noted; pressure shifts toward Red.
- DeMarco’s padlock left as contrast; decision to let City work before breaking wood.

# Chapter 14 — Ledger Knock

The certificate liked the morning. It took the light and made it square. The tape held its breath and didn’t lift. The stamp below it looked old on purpose.

Maggie set the ledger on the bar the way you set a tray when a room needs to see you’re steady. She flipped to a clean page. The chain sat under her right hand like a tame thing.

“Coffee?” she said.

“Yes,” I said. I didn’t need it.

The phone rang once and thought better of it.

At ten a man in a hat came in with a smile that wasn’t his and a card that had changed jobs overnight. NEIGHBORHOOD COMMITTEE, it said, in the kind of type you buy by the dozen.

“Morning,” he said. “I can ease the burden of daily posting. Consolidate to Mondays. City allows latitude when there’s a friendly hand.”

“City likes paper,” Maggie said.

“It likes procedure,” I said. “City runs on paper.”

He put the card on the rail and tapped it like it was a tune. “Discretionary fund keeps relations sweet. It’s civic.”

“Candy with a new wrapper,” I said. “No.”

He tried a different door. “Weekly counter turnover invites confusion. A lady could get numbers wrong. I can help.”

“She can count,” I said.

He moved his weight and made a show of reading the certificate. “This is ambitious for a small room.”

“It’s public,” Maggie said. “That’s the size we like.”

The door let in cold and Dugan with it. He took the end and watched nothing happen.

“Sergeant,” I said.

“Committee,” he said to the man without looking at the card. “You boys never run out of cards.”

“We facilitate,” the man said. “Neighbors help neighbors.”

“Help by leaving,” Dugan said. “Neat’s working. Don’t smudge it.”

The man left the card and the air changed after him. Dugan didn’t touch the rail. He never does when he’s making a point without words.

“Coffee?” Maggie said.

“Neat,” he said, and stepped outside again to listen to the sidewalk remember its lines.

Vic came in with his hand wrapped in a dish towel he pretended not to notice. He took it off and put it on the bar like a thing that had happened to someone else.

“You working?” he said.

“I’m standing,” I said. “Working comes later.”

He flexed the fingers that wanted to be useful. “They’ll be back.”

“They always come back,” I said. “We decide how loud.”

He nodded at the window. “That’s loud enough.”

A boy from City passed on the sidewalk with a leather bag and a stack that rode high. He didn’t look in. He didn’t have to. The building had our name in a box somewhere and would open it when it wanted us.

At eleven, a man with office air and shoes that had never been on the wrong floor came in and stood by the stamp. He read the certificate and then the notice under it and then us.

“Confirming yesterday’s counter turnover,” he said. “Beginning next Monday, four o’clock. For our sheets.” He had a clipboard that belonged to a different department and a pencil that had been chewed by someone else.

“For your sheets,” Maggie said.

He took the words and made a note. He didn’t order. He left the room the way it was.

“That a friend of yours?” Vic said.

“No,” I said. “Just time wearing a hat.”

The radio coughed a race call a breath late and forgot to apologize. The city kept time for both of us. That was the touch and I let it sit.

At noon the phone rang twice and stayed on. Maggie picked up. “Palmer.”

Accounts voice. Flat. “Reconciliation review memo acknowledged,” he said. “Supplemental request for ledgers and route sheets transmitted to Malloy Office. For our sheets.”

“For your sheets,” Maggie said. She hung up and looked at me like the line had hands.

“Paper’s moving,” she said.

“Good,” I said. “Let it run.”

Vic whistled low and ugly. “Malloy won’t like that.”

“He won’t like the totals,” I said.

A man with a union pin I recognized from the lanes came in and bought a coffee he didn’t drink. He put a nickel on the rail and didn’t look at the window. Not looking is a kind of reading.

“You post daily now,” he said.

“We always did,” Maggie said.

He watched her face long enough to learn nothing and left the nickel and the cup.

“First beat,” I said when the door settled. “He didn’t like the count he thought he saw.”

“That’s one,” Maggie said. She kept the second for when it bought something.

At one a messenger in a blue cap took the hill toward Malloy’s office with a sealed envelope under his arm and a smile you see on boys who don’t know they carry fire. Dugan drifted after him without looking like he was drifting.

“You going to watch?” Vic said.

“I already am,” I said. “From here.” The ribs ask questions when you give them stairs. I didn’t.

The consultant came back at two with another card that said LIAISON again, as if the last twenty minutes had been a different kind of morning. He tried the door about weekly postings one more time. Maggie didn’t move.

“You can tell Red he can read the window like anyone else,” she said. “If he has questions about the font, he can take them to City.”

“You’re making enemies,” he said.

“We had them,” I said. “We’re making them read.”

He looked at the ledger on the bar and didn’t touch it. Men show you what they fear by what they don’t touch.

At three a man from the paper stopped in to ask about music on weekends and left with nothing to print. He took the smell of ink with him.

At three-thirty the boy in the blue cap came back from the hill without the envelope and without the smile. He looked at the window and then at me like he’d learned the word subpoena without being taught to say it.

“Trouble?” I said.

“Not for me,” he said, and kept moving.

At three fifty we put totals in an envelope even if nobody had asked. Habit saves you when courage won’t. Maggie wrote the time on the flap and pressed it with her thumb the way she did yesterday. She licked the seal like a promise and handed me the walk.

“Ribs?” she said.

“They’ll complain,” I said. “They like to hear themselves.”

Ms. Hart was at the desk. “Early,” she said.

“Practice,” I said. I slid the envelope. She nodded at a sheet half under her hand.

“You didn’t see this,” she said.

“I never do,” I said.

It read REQUEST FOR BOOKS in a header that didn’t know it was a threat. Below, MALL0Y OFFICE, ledgers, route sheets, last three months. A time tomorrow morning with a room number and a line for a signature.

“Out by hand?” I said.

“Boy with a cap,” she said. “He had a smile for the first half.”

“Dugan?”

“He’ll loiter,” she said. “If Red makes a scene, the room will do the work.”

I nodded. The room would do the work.

Back at the bar the late light made a square on the floor where the jukebox threw it. The certificate held a corner. The stamp held the rest. Vic’s towel had a spot of red on it that had dried to brown without asking permission.

“DeMarco?” Maggie said.

“Padlock still up,” Vic said. “They posted VOLUNTARY in block letters like a joke. The boy at shoes at the lanes says a man asked him what the serial on our stamp means. He said it meant we could spell.”

“Smart boy,” I said.

We opened the register long enough to slide receipts into a folder and close it before anyone could read us wrong. Maggie set the ledger down where the room could see it and then put her hand on it like you do with a Bible when a man tells lies in front of you.

The door opened on a draft and a man with the jaw from the lanes stood there like he had practiced the position.

“You’re real proud of your paper,” he said.

“It keeps time,” I said.

“Time runs out,” he said.

“Not today,” I said.

He looked at the stamp and at the certificate and at us. He had a speech in his pocket and forgot the first line.

“Red wants the Monday thing to be later,” he said finally. “After five.”

“Four,” Maggie said. “City likes four.”

“You like four,” he said.

“We like not riding,” I said.

He stared long enough to pretend he’d won something and left. The door breathed behind him.

“Second beat,” Maggie said, quiet. “He tried to move the count.”

“That’s two,” I said. “We’re done.”

We wiped the rail for no reason except habit. The light on the glass went from white to the color the city makes right before it remembers the dark.

Turn
- Consultant fails to mute postings; Dugan keeps “neat.”
- Accounts serves Malloy Office: request for ledgers/route sheets; reconciliation review set.
- Red tests the schedule and eats his words; pressure shifts to his books.

# Chapter 15 — Concerned Accountant — Seed the Shortfall

The room had a clock with no second hand. The hall moved without it.

Malloy’s outer office smelled like carbon and cold coffee. A girl at a desk took names and kept a pencil behind her ear like it had seniority. Behind the glass door: RECONCILIATION REVIEW. Below that, smaller: REQUEST FOR BOOKS. Someone had put the header where men in hats could read it from the hall.

Vic stayed on the bench because stairs weren’t his today. He held the bag on his knees and looked at the floor like it owed him money and was about to pay. My ribs kept me on the ground and out of the doorway. We were where the room could see us without having to hear us.

A man with a square tie came out with a folder and a face that wanted to be patient. “Malloy,” he said to the hall. He didn’t have to say Red. The name did its own work.

Two of Red’s boys went in first. The union pin had starch. The jaw kept a key ring he couldn’t stop touching. They sat where the table made them small.

Dugan leaned against the water cooler and watched the corridor like it might confess. He didn’t open the door. He didn’t need to. Public meant he could loiter and call it a day’s work.

The girl looked up. “You with them?”

“No,” I said. “We’re the ones who post.”

She didn’t smile. She didn’t have to. She slid a sign-in toward me anyway. “For the room,” she said.

Inside, a name plate said A. FALCO. The man under it was younger than the plate wanted. He wore his neat like a uniform. He stacked ledgers on a low table and set a blotter like a line you don’t step over.

“Ledgers and route sheets for the last three months,” he said without raising his voice. “We’ll look at spreads and signatures. We’ll keep the room open.” He meant the glass and the door and the eyes in the hall. He meant Red could be seen being reasonable.

The pin put a book on the table like it might break. The jaw laid a sheet on top that said ROUTE in the hand I’d watched pretend to write. Falco wrote the time in the corner. Nine-oh-seven. He didn’t hurry. He let the clock do the work.

“We turned over Monday at four,” I said, quiet, to no one who asked. “Receipts read right.”

Vic tapped the bag with one finger. “Copies,” he said.

Dugan’s eyes moved. He heard what he needed and nothing else. “Neat,” he said to the air. “Keep it that way.”

Falco started simple. “Penn,” he said. He opened the ledger and put the payout against the counter line. Not the number a man had written for show. The number the little window had told him when he asked for it. “Two forty-two on the cabinet. Two thirty-four to the room. Eight short. Manager’s hand here. Yours?” He looked at the pin. The pin nodded like nodding was a skill.

“That drift is normal,” the jaw said. He tried to make normal sound like a rule.

Falco didn’t look up. “It’s normal until it isn’t. That’s why we read three months.” He turned a page. “Lanes. Club. Fridays.” He let the pattern write itself.

The door stayed open. A messenger walked past and slowed enough to read REQUEST FOR BOOKS without looking like he had. A man from the paper stood at the end of the hall and pretended to check his watch. Public. We’d wanted that.

The jaw shifted to make himself bigger. The chair reminded him where he was. He settled. The key ring was quiet.

Falco’s pencil paused. “These route sheets,” he said. “Why are totals carried forward in a different hand?” He didn’t say whose hand. He didn’t have to. He put his finger where ink darkened like a man had leaned too hard.

The pin said nothing. That was wise.

Falco stacked two sheets and set the blotter on them. “We’ll need the originals by Friday noon.” He spoke to the room, not the men. “Bring the books you keep for yourselves. Or tell me why you can’t.”

Dugan blew one slow breath through his nose. Not a laugh. Permission.

“You can’t demand that,” the jaw said, finding his courage late and cheap.

Falco didn’t blink. “I can request. The City can subpoena. Either way, you’ll be seen bringing them or refusing to.” He looked at the glass. He didn’t look at Dugan.

The pin saw the headline he didn’t want. He reached for the ledger like it might hide him. It didn’t.

Vic’s hand clenched and then let go. “Paper lever,” he said under his breath. “Not muscle.”

“One,” I said. That was enough counter talk for the morning.

Falco wrote two lines on a yellow sheet and tore the top copy. He slid it across. “Acknowledged. Return this with what I asked. By Friday noon.” He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t have to. The room was doing the work.

We didn’t go in. We didn’t have to. We stayed on the bench and let the second hand we couldn’t see move the day.

# Chapter 16 — Mentor Flex

The hall cooled after they left. The girl at the desk put the pencil back behind her ear like she’d never moved it.

Vic looked at me like a dog looks at a gate. “We hit three rooms,” he said. “Buckets. While they count in there, we take what makes them sweat.”

“No,” I said.

“Why not?”

“Because the door is open,” I said. “Let the room do the work.”

He made a face like I’d fed him plain oatmeal. “You get poetry when you starve.”

We walked slow back to the street. Dugan let the water cooler hold up the wall without him and drifted behind us far enough to be an accident.

At Maggie’s, the light liked the certificate. It always did. She wiped the corner of the glass for the look of it and set the ledger where a man could see it and not reach.

“Malloy?” she said.

“Friday noon,” I said. “Originals.”

Vic set the bag down and tapped it like a metronome. “We can make their hands shake before Friday. Lanes, Penn, the club. Same day. They won’t know which hole to plug.”

“They’ll call it theft of time,” I said. “Then they’ll get the padlock they wanted and a friend to turn the screw. We’re posted. We’re neat. Let them argue with paper under their own glass.”

He didn’t like that answer. He didn’t have to.

I moved the observation order a thumb’s width so the serial sat dead center under the city’s seal. I slid the chain ledger open to Monday and checked our copy against the copy Ms. Hart had left like a man counting a kept promise.

“Say it back,” I said to Vic.

He sighed and did, because his mouth knew how to teach his hands. “Friday noon. Originals. We don’t give them a scene before that. We post. We count. We let the room do the work.”

“Good,” I said. “And you stay off stairs.”

“Priest with a clock,” he said, and almost smiled.

We rehearsed the lines we didn’t plan to say. Penn: the window read two forty-two, payout two thirty-four, manager’s hand. Lanes: the window read two forty-four, till two thirty-six. That was two. We put the book away before we taught ourselves to love the sound of it.

Maggie kept the envelope habit alive—time on the flap, thumb press—on an empty one. Practice matters more than hunger.

“DeMarco?” she said.

“Padlock stays,” I said. “It teaches the block what loud looks like.”

Vic stood, restless. “I need to move or I’ll chew the bar.”

“Take a walk in daylight,” I said. “Bag on your shoulder. Don’t touch a lock. Let three rooms see you carry tools and not use them. That’s the flex.”

He blinked. “That’s your idea of buckets?”

“That’s my idea of public,” I said.

He went. He left the door to think about closing and it did.

I stayed where the window could read me. A car slowed, saw the certificate, and remembered the light. A union pin looked in and then looked at his shoes. Men learn.

The consultant came by with a new card he didn’t show. He saw the ledger on the rail and kept his hands in his coat. Smart for once.

Maggie typed a small strip that said COUNTERS TO CITY — MONDAY 4 P.M. She taped it under the observation order, square. Not new. Just loud.

“You like that?” she said.

“I like it where men in cars can read it,” I said.

Noise spends fast. Quiet accrues.

Vic came back with the cold on his coat and a grin that almost reached his eyes. “I walked past the club twice,” he said. “Pin watched me and decided to be thirsty somewhere else.”

“Good,” I said. “You’ll do it again tomorrow.”

He made a noise that lived between agreement and pride. “Friday noon,” he said, like he was reminding himself.

“Friday noon,” I said. “You carry the bag. You don’t open your mouth.”

“Who does?”

“The room,” I said.

We posted the day’s small receipts where paper wanted to live and let them breathe. The radio called a race a breath late. The city didn’t wait. It never does.
