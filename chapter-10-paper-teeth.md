# Chapter 10 — Paper Teeth

Hook
- Concrete image: The notice under the stamp bled red pencil at the corners where the tape pressed it flat.

Beat goals
- Real inspection arrives. Red tries to weaponize it; Johnny forces procedure to slow custody.
- Dugan stays hands-off but present; repeats “neat or ride” by absence—he only moves if they don’t keep it neat.
- Counters used twice: coin count vs. payout discrepancy; chain-of-custody ledger.
- Vic friction persists; he pushes for buckets; Johnny refuses.
- One aphorism max; one motif touch.
- End on a turn: the inspection’s paper opens a door—permit pathway that can legalize Maggie’s box, under a price.

Notes
- Target: 1,100–1,300 words
- Motif: city as metronome

Draft

At nine forty-five I set the towel aside and read the notice again. Same red pencil time. The corners showed thumbprints. Men always leave prints when they hurry.

Maggie wiped the glass where the stamp sat. “You want coffee for them?”

“For the paper,” I said. “It does most of the talking.”

She brewed anyway. She liked to feed enemies. It made friends nervous.

They came at ten sharp with a second car behind them, this one city, not Ford. The gray coat had upgraded to a tie. The ring had a new lock in his pocket and a grin that thought ahead. Shoulders carried a flat wooden box with twine.

A woman in a navy suit stepped in last. Clipboard, real authority, not the borrowed kind. She took in the room the way a tailor takes in a man. “Inspection,” she said, and didn’t have to prove it.

“Welcome,” I said. “We laid out what you’ll need.” I put the receipt book, the serial sheet, and a fresh pad on the bar, clean. Maggie set down pens like little spears.

The woman glanced at the notice under the stamp and at the stamp itself. “You posted.”

“We like to be seen,” I said.

“Good,” she said. “My name is Ms. Hart.” She nodded at gray coat. “He’s with me today. He wasn’t yesterday.”

Gray coat swallowed something he didn’t want to eat.

Dugan stood outside under the awning and smoked. He watched the sidewalk like it might confess. He didn’t come in. It meant he didn’t have to. Neat kept him where he wanted to be.

“Order of operations,” Ms. Hart said. “Back door hardware first. Then the device. If we secure, we inventory together.”

“That’s the order,” I said.

We went to the back. She looked at the bright lock plate and the proud screws. “Who installed this?”

“Not us,” Maggie said.

“Do you have a work order?” Ms. Hart said to gray coat.

He didn’t. The ring jingled his keys to make sound where there wasn’t an answer.

Ms. Hart tilted the plate once with a thumbnail. The screws didn’t like it. “Remove it,” she said. “Wrong hardware. Wrong hands.”

The ring started to argue and found no words that could stand up. He took the plate off and held it like it might bite him. It didn’t.

“Door passes,” Ms. Hart said. “Front stamp is in order.” She tapped the glass. “Now the device.”

At the jukebox she opened the top with a small tool from her bag. No flourish. She knew machines. The smell of dust and coins walked out.

“Count,” she said, and handed gray coat the pad.

“I’ll do it,” Maggie said.

“You witness,” Ms. Hart said. “I’ll do it.” She started clearing the coin tray into the flat box Shoulders carried. Coins hit wood with a steady sound. She called numbers. “Two twelve. Two nineteen. Two thirty-one.”

I wrote them in the chain ledger and kept my handwriting straight. The ring leaned to see and didn’t like seeing.

“Payout?” Ms. Hart said.

“Two thirty-four,” I said. “Last night. Manager signature. Counter window said two forty-two.”

“That spread is directionally consistent with normal drift,” gray coat said, using words that didn’t belong to him.

“Not with the stamp that high,” I said.

She didn’t smile. “Noted.” She pulled a record and checked the selector like she was making sure it still wanted to sing. “Who services selections?”

“We do,” I said. “When they’re tired.”

“You have invoices?”

“Receipts,” I said, and slid the book open to a page that had lines and dates. She looked until she was done, not until she saw what she wanted.

Dugan flicked ash outside. He watched the metronome go. Buses took the corner on time. The city stayed on beat.

“We can secure,” gray coat tried again. The ring touched the new lock in his pocket like a pet.

Ms. Hart shut the lid. “Not today. No immediate hazard. Device is posted and inventoried. Recommended action: permit review and service schedule. I’ll note the counterfeit notice from yesterday.” She looked at me. “You kept the towel over it. Why?”

“To keep the tape from lifting ink,” I said.

“Neat,” she said, and wrote it.

Vic drifted closer. “We done?”

“Almost,” I said.

Ms. Hart wrote for a long minute. Gray coat watched his future shrink. Shoulders looked at the floor he understood.

“Two options,” Ms. Hart said. “One, you operate as-is under observation with weekly counters turned over to our office. Two, you apply for a cabaret adjunct permit that formalizes the device and sets a fixed skim.”

Gray coat brightened. “Fixed skim,” he said, because he heard his boss’s name in it.

Ms. Hart kept writing. “The fixed skim goes to the city.”

The light in his eyes went out.

“What does the permit cost?” Maggie said.

“Money,” Ms. Hart said. “And consistency. You’ll be seen more. You’ll be protected more.”

Maggie looked at me. I nodded once. Protection you can read beats protection you can’t, until it doesn’t. The aphorism tried to climb out. I kept it in.

“We’ll take the observation for now,” I said. “We like paper that breathes.”

“Then sign,” Ms. Hart said. “Chain of custody for today’s count stays with me. Copy for you.”

I signed. Maggie signed. Ms. Hart signed. The room felt lighter just because the pen moved.

She tore the counterfeit notice in half and handed the pieces to gray coat. “If you come back with one of these, bring better.”

He put the halves in his pocket like he might tape them later and learned nothing.

At the door Ms. Hart paused at the stamp. “Keep it posted.”

“We like to be seen,” Maggie said again. It sounded like faith when she said it.

They left without the lock. Dugan ground his cigarette out in the snow and tipped two fingers through the glass. He didn’t come in. He didn’t have to.

Vic came up on my shoulder. “So that’s it,” he said. “No buckets. No padlock. Just paper.”

“Paper with teeth,” I said.

He looked at my ribs when I reached for the towel. “Until it bites us.”

“Everything does,” I said. “Pick your bite.”

We put the towel back over the new form—observation order, chain ledger copy stapled to it. The radio called a race a breath behind. The city didn’t slow down for any of us.

By late afternoon two regulars asked about the inspection like it was weather. Maggie showed them the posting. They nodded. A man at the far stool left a tip larger than the coffee demanded. Sometimes neat pays.

Near close a boy from City ran in with an envelope and no breath. He saluted the stamp like it was a flag. “From Ms. Hart,” he said.

Inside: a permit packet, clipped. A note in tight hand: If you want the adjunct, bring these Wednesday, two o’clock. No intermediaries.

Maggie swallowed. “That’s fast.”

“They want to own the song,” I said.

“Do we?”

“We want to pick it,” I said. “Owning comes later.”

She put the packet under the register, on top of the napkin with our terms. It rode there like it belonged.

Outside, the blue X on the alley door looked small against clean wood. The screws had holes to remember where they tried to live.

We locked up. The stamp held the last light and let it go. The notice under it wasn’t red now. It was black ink and carbon. The turn wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be.
