# Chapter 6 — Route Cadence Map

Hook
- Concrete image: Butcher paper taped to a bar table; coins for pins.

Beat goals
- Fix roles: bag, hands, eyes; who carries which key.
- Lock timing windows: arrive 1:15, step 1:28.
- Choose first hit night (not Saturday); pick the room.
- Set drop, tail cut, and rendezvous rules.
- Keep pressure low; codify tells in daylight language.

Notes
- Target: 1,000–1,200 words
- One aphorism max; 1–2 counter/math beats
- Motif: city as metronome, not glamour

Draft

We spread butcher paper on Maggie’s back table and kept our elbows off because she asked us to once and we pretended it was a rule.

Vic drew a crooked river and called it a street. He used beer rings for rooms and nickels for men who thought they owned them. I moved the nickels until the picture made noise.

“Wednesday,” he said, and circled the lanes on the North Side. “Service call. You take the hands. I carry the bag.”

“You carry the bag,” I said. “You keep the door in your eye. I don’t want your hands on the brass unless the room asks for a dance.”

He spun a nickel like a trick he’d taught himself to stop thinking. It clattered and laid down.

“Arrive?” he asked.

“One fifteen,” I said. “Window opens at one twenty-eight. You miss it, you get men on lunch, and they notice what’s supposed to be furniture.”

He wrote the numbers like they were gospel and not memory. 1:15. 1:28. He boxed them like the boxes could hold a day still.

“The girl,” he said. “Placards Thursday. She makes it look like we were hired by a man with a clipboard.”

“She posts and leaves,” I said. “She doesn’t wait to be thanked.”

“You don’t like thanks anymore,” he said.

“I count daylight,” I said. “Thanks get you seen.”

He smiled at that like he didn’t want to and drew an X over Saturday at the supper club.

“Buckets live on Saturday,” he said.

“Buckets make noise,” I said. “We’re buying quiet.”

Maggie brought coffee and shoved the ashtray into the corner where we’d parked the city.

“You boys put that paper away if a man in a hat walks in,” she said. “And don’t use my good nickels.”

“Never,” Vic said, palming two he could no longer swear were hers.

I put a short line between the lanes and a gin mill with a floor that remembered shoes. Then a longer line between the gin mill and a supper club with soup and a manager who trusted his memory more than numbers. I drew a third line from the lanes to a back door nobody used in daylight.

“That,” I said, tapping the third line, “is how we leave if they turn the stage lights on.”

Vic nodded. “Tail cut here,” he said, drawing a small circle at the grocer’s alley. “Crates, a truck, a man who minds his own. You cough if we carry the tail through the alley. Ear for nickels. Rail for a smoke walk. Same tells; different air.”

“Same tells,” I said. “No new signals until we need them.”

He wrote the tells along the bottom edge like they were a prayer you could teach a child: Watch=cough. Ear=nickels. Rail>3=smoke walk.

“Keys,” he said, and put a penny over the lanes and a dime over the club. He patted his pocket. It clicked. “Twin for South Side cabinet. Yours for the lanes.”

“My ring and file,” I said. “If the twin lives in the bag, it doesn’t get curious in your hand.”

He let that sit on his pride and didn’t feed it. “Fair.”

We ran the clock without leaving the room. One twelve: pin with the union walks through a door like he kept the hinge in his pocket. One fifteen: we arrive. One twenty-eight: we act. Two ten: jaw with the key ring makes the gin mill honest in the way men call honest when the room is full and the numbers are round.

“Counter beat,” Vic said. “The club paid on a round. Window read odd.”

“One,” I said. “Save the second for when it buys something.”

He marked a single dot over the club and kept the pencil still.

“First hit,” he said. “Say it out loud so I stop asking.”

“Lanes,” I said. “Wednesday. Service call. We touch one cabinet. We switch one box down the line when the building says yes.”

“Who’s the building?”

“The bartender’s watch,” I said. “The phone that rings and doesn’t matter. The man who steps outside for a smoke when the soup gets to a boil. The city tells you when it wants something. You just don’t insult it by asking.”

He laughed once without joy. “You sound like a priest married to a clock.”

“I sound like a man who can’t run stairs until spring,” I said. “We’ll take the ramp.”

Maggie leaned in the doorway and watched the coins like they might give her a race result.

“You going to need a door held?” she said.

“You’ll hold it by letting it close slow,” I said. “And you call a number that rings a store where nobody answers if anyone asks for my boss.”

“I like that number,” she said. “It never argues.”

Vic slid the dime to the edge of the paper and flicked it into his palm. “Rendezvous if we spook?”

“Two blocks east at the tailor with the radio in the window,” I said. “He fights the antenna at two thirty like he’s paid to lose. We buy thread we don’t need. We talk with our backs.”

“And if the tail makes church with us?”

“Market alley,” I said. “Crates, rope, oranges. You put the bag in the truck for a count of five. If nobody climbs in after it, you carry it out the other side. If somebody does, you leave it and we walk. We can buy a new bag.”

He didn’t like leaving the bag. He accepted it.

“Memo?” he said.

“After,” I said. “One memo, one line. Times and the number that didn’t match the smile. We send it to the bean-counter who thinks numbers make men honest.”

Vic looked at the paper until it was wood again.

“Say it back,” I said.

He did, not to please me, but so his mouth would make the shape his hands needed later.

“Wednesday. North Side lanes. One fifteen arrive. One twenty-eight move. Bag with me, hands with you. Watch=cough. Ear=nickels. Rail>3=smoke. Tail cut in the grocer’s alley if they make choir robes out of our shadows. Rendezvous at the tailor if we don’t like the choir.”

“And keys,” I said.

“Twin in the bag until the day it gets used,” he said. “Ring and file on you. I don’t touch unless the room asks for a dance.”

Maggie nodded like she was marking it for a quiz none of us wanted.

I folded the butcher paper once and then again and slid it under the ledger where Maggie keeps the names men tell her and the ones she learns herself.

“You going to sleep?” Vic said.

“I’m going to walk the block until I can see the clock without looking,” I said. “You’re going to go home and stop polishing that twin in your head.”

He picked up the bag and made a face at being told what to do without being told. “Tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow,” I said.

He left the room like he owed it money and was paying in charm. Maggie took the nickels and put them back in the register one by one.

“You boys always think the city talks,” she said.

“It does,” I said. “It just doesn’t care if you hear it.”

We turned the chairs up. We locked the door we’d unlock in daylight. The butcher paper under the ledger made the table look thicker. The room kept its own time. So did we.

When the switch came, we let the room read us.
