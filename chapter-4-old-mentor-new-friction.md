# Chapter 4 — Old Mentor, New Friction

Hook
- Concrete image: Vic’s hat on the bar before he is.

Beat goals
- Reintroduce Vic: warmth, history, quiet test over who calls plays.
- Keep rivalry under affection; show, don’t declare.
- Seed his hunger for “buckets” against Johnny’s narrow lane.

Notes
- Target: 1,000–1,200 words
- One aphorism max; 1–2 counter/math beats
- Physicality: Johnny’s ribs a small cost; aftermath emphasis

Draft

Vic’s hat hit the bar first. Grease on the brim, not from work— from a man who touches the same place when he thinks. Then the hand. Then the grin.

“Johnny Byrne,” he said. “Hell of a thing to see you standing up.”

“It’s easier than the other way,” I said.

We didn’t shake. We bumped shoulders like boys who’d spent a winter stealing coal together. Maggie watched us and poured two coffees without being asked.

“You still take it black?” Vic said.

“I take it,” I said.

He laughed once and let the bar take his weight. He looked around the room like he owned it in a past life and was considering a second try.

“Red’s boys been respectful?” he said.

“They broke a stool,” I said.

“Gentle, then.” He took his coffee, sipped, set it down. No sugar. “You working?”

“I’m helping a neighbor.”

“That what we call it?” He drummed a slow rhythm on the wood with two fingers. “I got a thought. You and me. One for the old days.”

Maggie set a plate of toast between us as if to bless and contain whatever came next.

“What’s the thought,” I said.

“Red’s skim has a cadence,” he said. “He pays short on the lanes on Thursday, makes it up at the club on Saturday, creams the gin mill on Wednesday because the books don’t care about Wednesday. Three hits, one week. Same night if you got the hands. They won’t know where the leak started.”

“Or they read the smoke and call a meeting,” I said. “We’re not running a circus.”

He held up a palm. “Little circus. Buckets for the trouble. You go narrow, you get nickels.”

“I like nickels I can spend,” I said. “Daylight nickels.”

“COUNT DAYLIGHT,” he said, and made it a toast with coffee instead of whiskey. “You always did like a slogan.”

“I like a plan that lives after I do.”

Maggie cleared the plate and left us to it.

“You still got a key man?” Vic said.

“I got a ring and a file,” I said.

“Good.” He tapped his pocket. It clicked. “I brought a twin for Red’s South Side cabinet. Clean work. You won’t find the mark unless you measure brass with a mic.”

“Who cut it?”

“A friend at a bowling alley who owes me shoes,” he said. “He’ll never miss them.”

“You paying him in buckets?”

“In mercy.” He smiled. “He thinks the world is fair.”

I let the smile pass.

“What do you want, Vic.”

“Another run with hands I trust,” he said. “It’s buckets, Johnny. I ain’t got ten winters left for nickels.”

“You got this winter,” I said. “Don’t spend it on pride.”

He watched me. He was measuring me with the same tool he used on locks. “You sound like a man who took a breath he didn’t think he’d get.”

“I did,” I said. “I like to keep it.”

He nodded like that was a fair religion, then leaned in so only the coins could hear us.

“Listen. I run the lanes Wednesday. You and the girl post the placards Thursday. Friday we do the service call at the supper club. Saturday you send your little memo to Falco’s bean-counter about the numbers that don’t match the smile.”

“Too wide,” I said. “One hit. One memo. We build pressure slow.”

He grinned. “You always were a miser.”

“Of noise,” I said.

Maggie came back with a ledger and set it down. “You boys write on paper if you’re going to talk business,” she said. “I like clean ears.”

Vic flipped it open like he’d been waiting for permission. He drew three boxes, wrote days under them, sketched arrows like a man laying track.

“You hear yourself?” I said. “You’re grinning at the ink.”

“I’m grinning at the math,” he said. “Counters don’t lie. Men do.”

“One counter beat,” I said. “Save the second for when it matters.”

He chuckled. “You reading me rules now?”

“I’m keeping you from reading me an obituary.”

He closed the ledger and patted it like a dog. “One hit,” he said, like he could say it without believing it.

“Service call,” I said. “North Side lanes. You carry the bag. I do the hands. You watch the room.”

“You don’t trust me to watch your hands?”

“Not when you enjoy it,” I said. “You stop seeing doors when you watch me.”

He took that and pocketed it. “Fair.”

We set tells. Watch equals cough. Ear equals nickels. Rail over three equals smoke walk. He repeated them until they were muscle.

“You hurt?” he said.

“On stairs,” I said.

“We’ll take the ramp.” He smiled like a promise.

The door opened and two coats came in with red ears. They took the end and pretended to be customers. Vic watched their shoes.

“Red’s,” he said.

I said nothing. He said nothing. Maggie set two beers in front of them and left the change on the wet wood like it didn’t matter. They drank half and left both close to full. They weren’t thirsty.

“You want me to say hello?” Vic said.

“I want you to finish your coffee.”

He finished it.

They left. The room breathed.

“You getting soft?” Vic said.

“I’m getting careful.”

He shook his head once, not angry. “Careful gets you old,” he said. “Old gets you small.”

“Dead gets you nothing,” I said. “Pick two.”

He laughed and slapped the bar. “You still got it.”

“I kept what I needed.”

We walked the route map once without leaving our stools. He named rooms by smells and chairs. I corrected him twice and let him correct me once. He noticed. I let him.

“You call it,” he said finally. “I’ll carry the bag.”

“We do one. We seed one. We sit still and let the building do work for us.”

“And if they hit back?”

“Then we count daylight.”

He made a face at the phrase and still nodded. “Tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow,” I said.

He stood, took his hat, and set it on his head. He looked older when he did it. The grin came back anyway. “You never did let me have the wheel,” he said.

“I hand it to you when the road’s straight,” I said. “This one isn’t.”

“Yet,” he said.

He went out into the cold like it owed him change. I watched him cross the window and disappear. My ribs nudged me for standing too fast. I sat and waited for the room to get quiet again.

Maggie wiped a circle on the bar I hadn’t dirtied. “I like him,” she said.

“I do too,” I said.

“He going to get you hurt?”

“Only if I let him.”

“You won’t,” she said.

“I won’t,” I said, and hoped I wasn’t lying.
