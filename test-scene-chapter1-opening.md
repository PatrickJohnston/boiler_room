# Test Scene — Chapter 1 Opening (Voice Stress Test)

The jukebox man smiled. His partner counted. Tuesday was quiet. Maggie stood at the end with a dish towel.

I took the service door and watched the room. Two men at the window. One at the corner. The one with the smile had the key ring and a pin on his lapel. He liked the weight of both.

They shorted her twenty dollars and a stool. The stool went when one of them leaned on it and kept leaning. He laughed. She didn’t. The pin flashed when he turned.

“You the union?”

“Just a neighbor.”

“Then drink your beer, neighbor.” He flicked a coin and missed the tip jar. He wanted the miss seen.

Maggie put the towel down. “We’re square,” she said. “Take your cut and go.”

They went. The smile took the broken stool with him. The door shut. The room breathed.

“You shouldn’t talk to them,” she said.

“I didn’t,” I said. “I opened my mouth.”

She almost smiled. “You said you were done,” she said.

“I was,” I said. “Then I came home.”
