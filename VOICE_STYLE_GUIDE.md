# VOICE & STYLE GUIDE

## Lawrence Block Style Analysis for THE WIRE

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. ECONOMY OF LANGUAGE

Block wastes nothing. Every sentence does work. No decorative prose.

#### Example (Block)

"I met her in a bar on Sunset. She had money written all over her."

**Not:**
"It was a warm evening in Los Angeles when I first encountered her in a dimly lit establishment on Sunset Boulevard. She appeared to be a woman of considerable means."

**For Johnny:**
"Claire was waiting at the Palmer House bar. She looked expensive and desperate. Sometimes that's the same thing."

---

### 2. SENTENCE STRUCTURE

**Short declarative sentences dominate:**

- Average 8-15 words
- Subject-verb-object clarity
- Fragments for emphasis
- Occasional longer sentence for rhythm variation

**Block pattern:**

Short. Short. Short. Medium sentence building tension or providing detail. Short punch.

**Example:**

"I walked. The streets were empty. Nobody followed me, but I checked anyway. In my line of work, paranoia keeps you breathing."

**Practice for Johnny:**

"The wire room smelled like cigarettes and fear. Eddie worked the telegraph. Claire watched the door. I watched Claire. Old habits."

---

### 3. PARAGRAPH LENGTH

- Most paragraphs: 1-4 sentences
- Very rarely more than 6 sentences
- White space creates pace
- Single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis

**Block:**
"She was lying.

I knew it, she knew I knew it, and neither of us said anything about it. That's how it works."

**For Johnny:**
"Martino smiled.

That was worse than threats. Men like Martino smiled before they killed you, not after."

---

### 4. FIRST PERSON PAST TENSE

**Block's default:** Past tense, retrospective narrator who survived to tell the story

**Effect:** Creates irony—narrator knows how it ends, reader doesn't

**Example:**
"I should have walked away then. Would have saved two lives and ten thousand dollars. But I didn't know that yet."

**For Johnny:**
"If I'd been smart, I would have checked Carver's story first. But Claire was there, and when Claire was there, I wasn't as smart as I thought."

---

## DIALOGUE

### BLOCK'S RULES

#### 1. No filler

- Cut greetings, pleasantries, anything that doesn't advance or reveal
- People talk in incomplete sentences
- Subtext over text

**Block:**
"You got it?"
"Half."
"That wasn't the deal."
"It's the new deal."

**For Johnny:**
"The jockey's solid?"
"Like bedrock."
"You've met him?"
Claire lit a cigarette. "I know people who know him."
"That's not what I asked."

#### 2. Attribution tags

- "Said" is invisible, use it
- Minimize adverbs (rarely "said softly/angrily/etc.")
- Action beats replace tags when possible

**Block:**
"I don't believe you," I said.
She shrugged. "Believe what you want."

**Not:**
"I don't believe you," I stated firmly.
"Believe what you want," she replied dismissively with a casual shrug.

#### 3. Real speech patterns

- Contractions
- Interruptions
- People talking past each other
- Regional/period appropriate

#### Period (1940s)

- "I ain't" (working class)
- "Square shooter," "on the level," "take a powder"
- "G-men," "bulls" (cops), "tin" (badge)
- "Sawbuck" (ten dollars), "C-note" (hundred)

---

## DESCRIPTION

### BLOCK'S APPROACH: Functional minimalism

#### Don't describe what doesn't matter

**Block:**
"The hotel room was small and dark. It smelled like a thousand other hotel rooms."

**Not:**
"The hotel room featured faded floral wallpaper, a brass bed with a sagging mattress, threadbare curtains filtering weak afternoon light, and an ancient radiator hissing in the corner."

**For Johnny:**
"Martino's office: leather chairs, walnut desk, family photos. The kind of place where a businessman breaks your legs."

### CHARACTER APPEARANCE

#### Introduce characters through specifics that matter

#### Block approach

- One or two details maximum on first appearance
- Details that suggest character or class
- Physical description through action

**Example:**
"Eddie's hands shook when he worked the keys. They always did after lunch."

**Not:**
"Eddie was a fifty-year-old man of medium height with thinning brown hair, watery blue eyes, a crooked nose, and hands that trembled from his drinking problem."

---

## ACTION/VIOLENCE

### BLOCK'S VIOLENCE: Swift, unglamorous, consequential

#### Principles

- No choreography
- Emphasize the aftermath over the action
- Physical consequences are real
- Violence changes characters

**Block:**
"He hit me twice. I went down. When I stood up, I couldn't see out of my left eye."

**Not:**
"His right fist rocketed toward my face in a devastating haymaker. I tried to dodge but wasn't fast enough. The impact exploded against my jaw like a thunderclap. A second blow, equally powerful, connected with my orbital bone. My legs turned to rubber and I collapsed to the ground. Minutes later, when I finally managed to rise on unsteady legs, I discovered my left eye had swollen completely shut."

**For Johnny:**
"The beating was professional. They avoided my face until the end. When they finished, I lay on the wet pavement and counted broken ribs. Three, maybe four."

---

## INTERNAL MONOLOGUE

### JOHNNY'S VOICE (First Person)

#### Characteristics

- Self-aware but not always self-honest
- Observant of others, blind to own flaws
- Wry humor masking pain
- Present observation + past reflection

#### Pattern

[Immediate observation] + [interpretation/reaction] + [broader meaning or callback to past]

**Example:**
"Claire touched my arm when she talked. Small gesture, calculated. She'd done the same thing in St. Louis before she cleaned me out."

#### Tone samples

**Cynical:**
"The mark believed every word. They always do. That's what makes them marks."

**Self-deprecating:**
"I was thirty-four and running the same cons I'd run at twenty. Some people call that consistency. I called it Saturday."

**Noir wisdom:**
"Chicago in February felt like the city was trying to kill you slow. The cold got in your bones and stayed there. Like regret."

**Observational:**
"Martino's enforcer stood by the door. He didn't move, didn't blink. That's how you knew he was dangerous. The ones who swagger are amateurs."

---

## PACING

### BLOCK'S RHYTHM: Vary to control tension

#### Slow (building)

- Longer sentences
- More description
- Internal reflection
- Character interaction

**Example:**
"I spent the afternoon watching Claire work the marks. She was good—better than she'd been in St. Louis. She laughed at their jokes, touched their sleeves, made each one feel like the smartest man in the room. It was art. It was also a lie, but that's what art is when you get down to it."

#### Fast (tension/action)

- Short sentences
- Sentence fragments
- Minimal description
- Rapid dialogue

**Example:**
"The door crashed open. Martino's crew. Three of them. Eddie ran. Made it two steps. I dove for the window. Didn't make it."

---

## EXPOSITION/THE CON

### BLOCK'S METHOD: Explain through action, not lecture

#### The wire service con needs explanation, but never in a lump

**Wrong:**
"The wire service con works like this: you set up a fake telegraph office and delay the race results reaching bookies. While they still think betting is open, you place bets on races already finished. The key is controlling the information flow and having plants at multiple bookies who can place bets quickly once you know the results."

**Right (spread across scenes):**
"The telegram came through at 4:47. The race finished at 4:45. That two-minute gap—that was our edge."

[Later scene:]
"Eddie worked two machines. One received real results from Churchill Downs. The other sent doctored results to the bookies. The bookies thought betting was still open. We knew better."

[Later scene:]
"Bobby walked into Keyes's betting parlor at 4:46. Slapped five grand on a horse that had crossed the finish line ninety seconds earlier. Far as Keyes knew, the race hadn't even started."

---

## CHAPTER OPENINGS

### Block's hooks: Drop into action or tension immediately

**Examples:**

"The letter from Claire arrived on a Tuesday. I burned it without reading it. Then I dug it out of the ashtray and read it twice."

"Martino kept me waiting an hour. When I finally got in, he offered me coffee. That's when I knew I was in trouble."

"The Derby was fixed. Or it wasn't. By the time I figured out which, three men were dead and I was next."

"I met Bobby Silk in a diner on Clark Street. He looked older. We all did."

---

## CHAPTER ENDINGS

### Block's technique: Turn or revelation that pulls reader forward

**Examples:**

"She kissed me goodnight at her hotel room door. I didn't go in. I went back to the wire room instead. That's where I found Eddie's body."

"Martino agreed to the split. Fifty-fifty, straight down the middle. We shook on it. His hand was cold. I understood then. He was going to kill me."

"I asked Carver about the fix. He looked confused. 'What fix?' he said. That's when I knew. Claire had been lying from the start."

---

## THINGS TO AVOID

**1. Purple prose**
❌ "The crimson sun descended majestically beyond the glittering Chicago skyline"
✅ "The sun went down. The city got dark."

**2. Overexplaining**
❌ "I felt a complex mixture of betrayal, anger, and residual affection"
✅ "I wanted to hate her. Couldn't quite manage it."

**3. Melodrama**
❌ "My heart shattered into a million pieces"
✅ "It hurt. I'd been hurt before."

**4. Modern language**
❌ "Let's circle back," "touch base," "bandwidth"
✅ Period-appropriate slang and syntax

**5. Authorial intrusion**
❌ "Little did I know that this decision would change everything"
✅ "I went in. Mistake."

**6. Elaborate metaphors**
❌ "Her betrayal was like a dagger forged in the fires of our shared past, plunging into the tender flesh of my naive trust"
✅ "She'd lied before. I'd known that. Believed her anyway."

## NOIR RESTRAINT (Johnny Byrne)

- Limit aphorisms to one per scene, max. Prefer concrete observation.
- Replace quips with action or detail (hands, rooms, counters, doors).
- When a line can be shown, cut the line and show it.
- Internal beats: present tense observation + one beat of meaning. Stop there.
- Dialogue: end one sentence earlier. Let subtext carry.
- Violence: aftermath over choreography. One image, one cost.
- Motifs (union, halls, North Side): flavor once, not a chorus.
- Counters/math language: use as lever, not shtick. 1-2 hits per scene.
- Default sentence: 8–12 words. Fragments only for pressure or punch.
- Chapter hooks: concrete image, not a wisecrack.

Checklist add-on
- [ ] One aphorism or less
- [ ] Two “math/counter” beats or less
- [ ] One motif touch (max)
## SAMPLE PASSAGES

### OPENING (Chapter 1 style)

"The letter arrived on a Thursday. No return address, Chicago postmark, my name typed on cheap stationery. I knew who it was from before I opened it. There's only one person in the world who sends me letters.

I burned it.

Then I pulled it from the ashtray, smoothed out the charred edges, and read it three times. The words didn't change. They never do.

Claire was in town. Claire needed help. Claire had a job that was too big for her alone.

That made four lies in three sentences. Claire didn't need help. Claire didn't have a job. And nothing was ever too big for Claire alone—she'd proved that in St. Louis when she took eight grand of my money and disappeared on a Tuesday morning.

I went to meet her anyway.

Some lessons you never learn."

### DIALOGUE SCENE

"Martino poured two glasses of brandy. Good stuff, not the rotgut they served at the betting parlors.

'You know why you're here, Mr. Hayden?'

'You want to make a deal.'

'I want you to stop.'

'Not the same thing.'

He smiled. 'No, it's not.' He slid one glass across the desk. 'You're running a wire service. Small operation, but it's on my territory. That's a problem.'

'I'm not stepping on your action.'

'You're breathing my air.'

I drank the brandy. It was excellent. 'What do you want?'

'Sixty percent. I provide protection, you provide expertise.'

'That's not sixty percent. That's a takeover.'

'Yes,' Martino said. 'It is.'

The room got very quiet. Outside, a car horn blared. Inside, two men looked at each other and calculated odds.

'I'll think about it,' I said.

'Don't think too long.'

I left the brandy glass on his desk. Didn't finish it. When a man like Martino offers you a deal that good, he's planning on killing you before the split."

### ACTION/VIOLENCE (Sample)

"They came through the door fast. Three of them, Martino's crew. I recognized the big one from the restaurant.

Eddie dropped his telegraph key and ran. Made it to the back room. They caught him anyway.

Claire went out the window. Smart. I tried to follow.

The big one hit me in the kidneys. I went down. He hit me again, lower. Professional work. They wanted me conscious.

'Where's the money?'

I didn't answer. Couldn't. The second enforcer kicked me in the stomach. I curled up, tasted copper.

'Mr. Martino wants his cut.'

They worked me over for five minutes. Maybe less. Felt longer. When they finished, I was still breathing. That was the point. Martino wanted me to know—this was just the warning.

They left Eddie in the back room. He wasn't breathing.

That was a warning too."

## DAILY WRITING PRACTICE

### Morning warmup (5 minutes)

Write 200 words in Johnny's voice. Any scene, any topic. Focus on rhythm and economy.

### Before each chapter

Read 2-3 pages of Block. Absorb rhythm. Start writing within 10 minutes of reading.

### During revision

Cut 10% of words. Tighten every sentence. If it doesn't work, it goes.
---

## CHECKLIST FOR EACH SCENE

- [ ] Every sentence does work (advances plot, reveals character, or builds atmosphere)
- [ ] Paragraphs average 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Dialogue sounds like 1940s speech, not modern
- [ ] Action is clear and swift
- [ ] Internal monologue reveals without explaining
- [ ] Description is functional, not decorative
- [ ] Chapter/scene has a hook and a turn
- [ ] Voice stays consistent: wry, cynical, economical

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**When in doubt, cut.**

Block's power comes from what he doesn't say. Trust the reader. Trust the story. Trust the white space.

---

## CANON TERMS

### Recall Event

- Use "Recall Event" as a defined contractual term in legal/expository contexts (docs, bank ops, narration explaining the mechanism).
- In dialogue where context is obvious, use the shorthand "the Recall" and the action "Trigger the Recall".
- Never write "trigger the Recall Event" or "triggering the Recall Event" in dialogue. Prefer "trigger the Recall".
- Keep capitalization:
  - Defined term: "Recall Event".
  - Shorthand in dialogue: "the Recall".
- Acceptable beats when reporting status in narration: "Recall Event triggered." or "Recall triggered." Choose based on whether the tone is legal/expository (first) or punchy voice (second).

Examples

- Expository/legal: "Per Exhibit C, a Recall Event authorizes immediate repurchase at 110%."
- Dialogue (shorthand): "Trigger the Recall."
- Avoid: "Trigger the Recall Event."
- Narration (status): "Pruitt's fund. Recall Event triggered."
