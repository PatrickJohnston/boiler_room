## Beats/Clocks

Wed p.m. optics-only flex — no new clocks; hold to Friday-noon originals.
- Deadline: Originals by Friday noon (Falco; yellow acknowledgment slip).

## Motifs (limit touches)
- City as metronome; counters as lever (twice per scene max). Keep REQUEST FOR BOOKS as a paper lever, not muscle.
- Let the room do the work.
- Noise spends fast. Quiet accrues.

## Loose Ends / Forward Hooks
- Accounts reconciliation lands at Malloy’s office; Red’s response branches: paper squeeze vs. muscle visit vs. audit attempt. Decide how public to make the push.
- DeMarco’s padlock left standing as contrast; monitor whether City or Red moves first there; leave the contrast in view.
- Vic’s hand recovery and route coverage; adjust tasks to avoid lid work; Vic off stairs on audit days; daylight walk-throughs only during optics-only flex.
- Consultant’s next play (neighborhood fund, discretionary “share”): deterred by postings; anticipate reappearance with a fresh angle/card.
- Dugan’s leash: he enforced once; during Malloy review he loiters; define boundary of “neat” during optics-only flex and if Red pushes inside a public office.
- Friday-noon originals at Falco: plan return path, optics, and who carries.
- Ribs cost accumulating; winter stairs limit movement; keep Johnny off stairs on audit days.
